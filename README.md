Food Animation - Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
=====

Chances have been made. I finally saw the beauty of this animation when a friend of mine endorses the [diets for women](http://www.leanrunnerbean.com) blog. From the creation of Chris Miller and Phil Lord, the Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is an animation that lead my new art to another level. 

The computer-animated science movie has various plots that will take you to another level of animation. The story is different, and you can learn how the animation created here:
