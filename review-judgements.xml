      <Review Name="Anupama Chopra" Affiliation="Hindustan Times" Date="August 09, 2013" Likes="2" Expected="ThumbsDown">In the interest of honest, unbiased reviews, let me begin by putting my biases on the table: I�m a sucker for Shah Rukh Khan. I�ve delighted in Rahul and Raj and the romantic fantasies they engendered over the last two decades. I cry when Rahul becomes a widower in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and swoon when Raj sweeps Simran in his arms amidst the swaying mustard fields in Dilwale Dulhania So it breaks my heart to tell you that Chennai Express left me cold. This hyper, eager-to-please Rahul sorely tested my patience. And after a while, the innumerable references to DDLJ seemed like a lazy shot at siphoning some of the enduring affection we have for that film. The fundamental problem is a clash of sensibility. Shah Rukh embodies the urbane, effortlessly suave and charming metro man. Director Rohit Shetty specialises in amped-up, largely logic-less and incoherent storytelling with a generous dose of low-brow humour that, at its best, is laugh-out-loud funny � do you remember that wonderful scene in Golmaal 3 in which Prem Chopra is humiliating his daughter�s poor suitor, played by Mithun Chakraborty? When Prem Chopra asks, �Karte kya ho tum?� Mithun Chakraborty, wearing a purposefully awful wig replies, �I am a disco dancer. Zindagi mera gana, main usi ka deewana.� It was priceless. But Chennai Express plays neither to Rohit�s strengths nor to Shah Rukh�s. It�s a strangely sloppy mishmash of cheesy humour, half-hearted romance, half-baked emotion and head-banging action. The film is filled with gigantic men whose size functions as a punch line. Yes, some of it is funny. The locations are beautiful. And I enjoyed watching Deepika Padukone as Meena, the don�s daughter with the thick accent, who meets Rahul on Chennai Express and turns his life upside down. Padukone�s spirited performance � she even makes that accent attractive � helps to lift the film. But, mostly, Chennai Express is a slog. Rohit�s movies have never been about plot or character or performances. His films have only one function: to entertain you by whatever means necessary. But sadly a film specifically designed not to bore does exactly that. Two weeks ago, I had interviewed Shah Rukh and asked him whether in choosing to do a determinedly loud, over-the-top film like Chennai Express, he was cheating on his core audience � urban, educated, metro folk. Shah Rukh replied that he would never cheat on us but that people who have loved his earlier avatars will just have to accept that he�s going through a phase. We do. Now come back Rahul. All is forgiven.</Review>

      <Review Name="Sukanya Verma" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="August 09, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">The trouble with brands is that you come to know what to expect. Director Rohit Shetty has achieved an enormous deal by being one but it has also limited his creative progress. Unlike his films, he's a pretty sharp guy but there's a sameness to his shtick. Does Chennai Express break away from it? Not always. But even with his overstating approach, it's decidedly more zany compared to all the Golmaal sequels and ilk he's doled out in recent years. Shah Rukh Khan's Eid release co-starring Deepika Padukone felt like a film that's better experienced with an audience instead of analysts. So I skipped the press screening and bought a ticket for a paid preview scheduled to start around the same time. Conscious of the afore-mentioned monotony and cultural stereotypes characterising Bollywood's depiction of any community, I entered the hall with a modest objective -- 10 laughs. If Chennai Express can give me a minimum of these many chuckle-worthy occasions, I'm good. Does it? Read on. It all starts with a bleeding SRK about to be hammered by some threatening brutes when his own voiceover rather pleasantly transports us to the land of Bollywood's favourite narrative technique -- flashback. Khan plays (S-U-R-P-R-I-S-E) Rahul. And he's (uh, belated happy birthday?) 40 and works as a (Gee, this is unique. And irrelevant), halwai. What triggers this movie's title is the endearing actor/filmmaker Lekh Tandon, in a brief appearance as Rahul's almost centenarian grandfather and Sachin Tendulkar's greatest fan. After he passes away, Rahul is assigned the task of immersing part of his ashes in Rameswaram's waters. Our man takes the first opportunity to resurrect his previously dead social life and hops on Chennai Express with Goa on his mind. A train about to leave the platform can only mean one thing --Dilwale Dulhania *Sigh* Le Jayenge. Miraculously enough, my scowl soon disappears into a smile and amplifies into a giggle responding to the unexpected spoof that follows. Mission laughter activated. Never to waste time on nuances, Shetty immediately sets stage for a wacky camaraderie between Rahul and Meenamma (Padukone works an excessive accent that marries Mehmood, Mithun Chakraborty and Lola Kutty --Jahan se hum train kheenchte hai wahin se station shuru hoti hai) as they converse in a medley of Bollywood songs while her four burly captors look on part hostile, part amused. Meenamma has standard issues-- rigid 'don-nna' father (an effective Sathyaraj) wants her to marry a boy of his choice but the focus is on SRK's breathless babbling and panicky reaction to her chaperone's sickle-flashing ways. Her lies and his willingness to play along leads this couple on a 142 minutes long adventure against the lush heartland of South India. Shetty seems to have deliberately kept the action away from cities to capitalise on the regional flavour dominating his script. A good chunk of Chennai Express is spoken in Tamil without any subtitles but the Hindamil/Tamindi screenplay ensures nothing is lost in translation or lack of it. Although there's no dearth of linguistic irreverence, the humour that actually works has nothing to do with word plays like kaafi/kaapi or Teriyama/Teri maa. The spunk here comes from attitude, the actors' compliance to be wholeheartedly loony, in enjoying not merely enacting, silly. And so it's easy to lap up the spontaneity with which Rahul taunts Tangaballi (Nikitin Dheer resembling Mukesh Rishi in Gardish ) as 'Hanger pe latke kaale kapde' or Shetty lets his imagination riot as usual with the 'Life of Pi' gag or Deepika pays a creepy tribute to Manjulika's (think Bhool Bhulaiya) tribe. Except that the scrumptious bits like the initially decent meal of a train journey soon makes way for stale leftover that pass off as morning breakfast. Once he runs out of jokes and jeeps to explode, Shetty dodders in classic stereotypes as well as his fondness for saturated colours, tossing in ugly visual effects. Unsure of where to head next or offer any explanation for the delay in the hero-heroine's romantic union, he constructs scenes of contrived sentimentality, laughable drama and extended violence. Ideally, the madcap tone of Chennai Express called for an equally quirky finish. Instead, the previously mousy Shah Rukh returns to his messiah roots bringing up the 66th year of Independence, parenting, women's rights in one breath followed by an endless session of crash, boom, bang simply to drive home his tag line for this Rahul: Never underestimate the power of a common man. The unintentionally funny thing here is the adverse treatment meted at SRK's endorsements -- Videocon-- harbinger of bad news, Pepsi -- an entire crate is banged in his direction and Nokia -- flung outside the train, in the name of embedded marketing. What stays put through and through is SRK's incredible charisma and gusto as he lightens the screen with his unabashed buffoonery, visibly enjoying his role as entertainer while lampooning it just the same. His effervescence is met with dazzling reciprocation in Deepika Padukone's 'Meena Washing Powder Meena' who gets top billing in the opening credits. There's so much control in the stunner's performances since the last couple of films. And her dynamic comic timing even against faulty sensibilities is part of that evolution. Finally, did I get my ten laughs? Well, I came *this* close. By the time the count had reached seven, Chennai Express decided to shift tracks from droll comedy to dreadful drama.</Review>

      <Review Name="Rajeev Masand" Affiliation="IBN" Date="August 10, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">Some films are hard to make sense of. Others are just nonsense. Chennai Express, directed by Rohit Shetty, ticks both boxes. More than a quarter of the film is in Tamil, and hence incomprehensible if you're unfamiliar with the language. The rest is a stew of puerile humor, lazy stereotypes, and way-over-the-top acting from a star who appears to be trying too hard. Shah Rukh Khan, who's provided enough evidence to convince us that he can do comedy effortlessly (remember 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa', 'DDLJ', and 'Main Hoon Na'?), spends a chunk of this film referencing his earlier hits, and bouncing off the walls like the Energizer bunny. Could he possibly be overworking himself to compensate for the film's tired writing? Because it's clear from 'Chennai Express' that Shetty has launched an elaborate expedition with a plot so thin, it could give a paper dosa a run for its money. That plot involves SRK's character, Rahul (yes, again!) boarding the 'Chennai Express', intending to sneak off to Goa to vacation with his buddies, although he's tasked with immersing his grandpa's ashes in Rameswaram. But when he encounters Meena (Deepika Padukone), who's on the run from her father (Sathyaraj), a don in a Tamil Nadu village, Rahul is tricked into going back with her and pretending to be her fiance. This comes with its own set of complications - Meena is betrothed to the hulking, glowering Thambabali (Niketan Dheer), which is why she made a mad dash from her village in the first place. As Rahul and Meena scramble all over South India to escape daddy's goons, we struggle to catch up. Chennai Express attempts to marry the puppy-dog sentimentality of a typical Shah Rukh Khan romance with the broad humor and the crash-bang-boom thrills of a Rohit Shetty action comedy. But the film does little justice to either genre. A big reason for that is the lethargic pacing. Shetty has pulled off cornier stories in the past, delivering gags and stunts at breakneck speed. This film, however, is a tough slog because the jokes aren't funny, and the set pieces entirely rehashed. In place of a real performance, Shah Rukh resorts to the sort of facial gymnastics that could shame an Olympian. To endure this indulgence, you have to be a die-hard fan. Deepika Padukone, meanwhile, stays firmly in character throughout. Her heavily accented Meena delivers some genuine laughs, particularly during one terrific scene in which she sleep-talks as if she were possessed. Six years after debuting opposite Shah Rukh in Om Shanti Om, she displays comic chops to rival his. The pair doesn't get much scope to ignite romantic chemistry, save for one scene after interval, when Shah Rukh carries Deepika in his arms, and proceeds to climb up 300 steps to a temple on the top of a hill. His face bathed in sweat, his eyes alive with intensity, Shah Rukh takes each step with unflappable commitment, and Deepika can't take her eyes off him. Alas, moments like these are in short supply here. What you get are insipid songs, a long sermon on women empowerment, more cars being flipped like pancakes and so many references to 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge' that you wish you were sitting in Maratha Mandir watching that film instead. I'm going with a generous two out of five for 'Chennai Express'. How to put this politely? It's a big, fat bore. A bloated vanity project for an actor capable of so much more.</Review>

      <Review Name="Shubhra Gupta" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="August 09, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">Wannakum, wannago? I went into Chennai Express dreading I would be doused, doused I tell you, with a staggering number of stereotypes, and that I would spend the film flinching and grimacing and counting the minutes. But as Chennai Express began chugging along, I found myself guffawing in a place. Or two. The laughs came intermittently through the first half, and I was still sitting in my seat at the interval. And then it turned into the same old story : the plot, which was thinner than a self-respecting wafer to start with, just gives up and dies, and the lead pair, Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone stop talking to each other (even as Padukone's thickly-accented "main aati, aur thum jaati" out-Mehmoods Mehmood at his most outre) and begin posturing. They have no competition from anything else : the trademark Shetty bang bang � car chases, jeeps blowing up, large groups of people charging at each other � is by now more eye glaze than ever. This could have been a good caper, in which madcap characters race around the countryside with other madcap characters in hot pursuit. Especially when Shah Rukh Khan is so willingly sending himself up as only he can, with such a knowing nudge-and-wink that you smile despite yourself. "Rahul", he introduces himself to Meenamaa (Padukone): "naam toh nahin suna hoga". You know you are being set up, and yet you can't help being amused. The amusement lasts only momentarily, and you are left feeling sorry at the waste. Rahul wants to head to Goa to party with his pals, but he gets on to the Chennal Express instead, to fulfil his late dadaji's dying wish. On that train hops the beauteous Meenakshi aka Meenamma, on the run from her appa (Sathyaraj) who is some kind of a don in a Tamil Nadu village, and who wants to marry her off. One thing leads to another, and the two reach said village. Towering hulk who is also would-be-groom (Dheer) arrives to growl and snarl. A phalanx of dark-complexioned fierce fellows shake sickles at Rahul, who is left to face a barrage of rapid-fire Tamilian yakkity yak, and a Meenamma who dimples prettily whenever she is given a chance, and a film that rapidly heads, ha ha, south.</Review>

      <Review Name="Vinayak Chakravorty" Affiliation="India Today" Date="August 09, 2013" Likes="526" Expected="ThumbsDown***">He always had the lung power. This time Shah Rukh Khan, in a bid to prove he still remains at the top of his game, is out gunning to score with lungi power. Chennai Express was always about giving SRK a wacky makeover. On cue, the superstar's latest co-production imagines a set-up he has hardly ever been a part of - loud and gaudy, packaged with all that jazz you expect in a film created Rohit Shetty ishtyle. If Shah Rukh goes for the Chennai Cut (which has worked wonders for Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn lately), Rohit lays out quite a masala gala. The standard Rohit Shetty film always looks like the script was added as an afterthought, and his latest is no exception. In that sense, Chennai Express is a crafty commercial product more than a film, riding the diligent hype SRK has drummed up over the past few months. The hype will ensure a whopper of an opening, and the circus on screen that uses every trick in the Rohit Shetty book should keep all fans happy. Cars fly. Hero flies. Villains fly. Hero and villains go for elaborate dhishoom doses. The naach-gaana drill has hordes of colourful extras in the backdrop - hordes so large they must have needed trucks to transport them to the scenic outdoors. Yeah, there is the patented Rohit Shetty bag of slapstick gags, too. The director uses it to set up a few spoof tricks, lampooning everything from SRK's biggest films (you won't miss the merry winks at DDLJ, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Dil Se or Main Hoon Na) to his own Golmaal films to the stock Rajinikanth image. A witty one about Shah Rukh's advancing age is particularly not to be missed. Essentially, this film is all about imagining SRK's trademark loverboy Rahul in a new set-up. He is called Rahul in this film, too. The name, you realise, is Shah Rukh Khan's assurance to fans that he isn't moving away from the image that created his superstardom, no matter the Chennai-style spread all around. He is still very much the nice guy, at heart a lover, as opposed to the rugged macho heroes Bollywood flicks with a South flavour normally peddle. An energetic first half pulsates with regular laughs, as Mumbai boy Rahul find himself aboard Chennai Express by default. He meets the feisty Tamil girl Meenamma (Deepika Padukone) and twist in Rahul's tale comes with her. Caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, there are plenty of misadventures in store. If brainless fun needs some brainwork to leave an impact, Chennai Express reveals a lot of it in the early hour. Then, as Rahul and Meenamma find themselves on the run from her extended family of goons, the narrative simply falls flat in the second half. It's almost as if Rohit lost interest in his own film after a point. Confusion over language difference is a convenient excuse to create gags all through. Puerile as it seems, it works in a way it can only in a Rohit Shetty film. Rohit has always operated with a mantra of excesses, arrogantly snubbing all intelligent criticism it may draw. He doesn't reveal any overt ambition to redefine the Bollywood comedy with this film either. Chennai Express banks largely on its lead pair to keep going. Shah Rukh is full of vim as ever, and you will love his madcap ride if you are willing to discount the odd ham bursts. Deepika's Meenamma adds a cutesexy charm to the film. She gets the full o' beans vibes about her act just right though her accented 'accented Hindi' could seem slightly taxing. They make a smashing duo in the supercharged Lungi Dance, though almost all the other songs are glossover fare. Chennai Express is a loud and crazy experience, so what if you might just forget all of it even as you hit the exit door after the show. It's got the lungi power while it lasts</Review>

      <Review Name="Rajeev Masand" Affiliation="IBN" Date="July 20, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">The problem with adoring, reverential portraits of real people is that they tend to lack objectivity and quickly become boring. It's true of Rang De Basanti director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, an ambitious account of the first 27 years or so of celebrated Indian sprinter Milkha Singh's roller-coaster life. Over an exhausting 3 hours and 7 minutes, the film, starring Farhan Akhtar as Milkha, details the athlete's journey from a boy displaced during Partition to his early years in a gang of petty thieves, followed by his recruitment in the Indian army from where he went on to become a sports hero. All this is revealed in a long flashback by Milkha's earliest coach, Gurudev Singh (an endearing Pavan Malhotra), during a train journey with Pandit Nehru's advisor, while pointing out why Milkha has turned down the Prime Minister's invitation to lead a sports delegation to Pakistan. (The explanation for that decision, painfully obvious to anyone with half a brain, is clumsily used as a suspenseful cliffhanger in the film). There are moments of great pathos here, and an inspiring lesson on the importance of perseverance and hard work. But it all moves at a snail's pace, even as the drama of Milkha's rise on the race track is punctured routinely by too many songs, overlong romantic tracks, and the kind of 'commercial-movie trappings' that are counterproductive to a film of this nature. Biopics, however panoramic in scope, usually boil down to a greatest-hits collection, and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, for all its sepia-toned flashbacks and terrific training sequences is no exception. It's a shame Mehra and screenwriter Prasoon Joshi adopt a manipulative, melodramatic approach to highlight Milkha's achievements and justify his failures. In the film's opening scene, a key moment in Milkha's professional career, he loses the lead in the 1960 Rome Olympics when he turns back, apparently because he was haunted by an image from his troubled past. In another scene, where Milkha wins an important race despite being badly injured, Mehra swells the score even as the bandages covering Milkha's wounds dramatically come off as he inches towards the finish line. And don't even get me started on the Gadar-esque finale in Pakistan, where Milkha must fulfill the dream of every Indian by beating a rival from our neighboring nation. Never before has slow motion and background music been so abused in a film! Not everything comes apart though. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy delivers some great tunes, particularly Zinda that is rendered with suitable energy by Siddharth Mahadevan. Mehra himself stages a rousing middle portion in Ladakh, where Milkha trains tirelessly with the India coach following a disappointment at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. This montage, gorgeously filmed, is a fine reminder of Farhan Akhtar's complete submission to the part. The actor in fact, and his committed performance, is the film's biggest strength. From his convincing accent and his dialogue delivery to the sheer beast of his physical presence, Farhan is riveting as Milkha. But Joshi's script, bursting at its seams with too much information that serves little purpose other than to establish Milkha as someone with a wholesome personality, shortchanges Akhtar with the weight of its mawkish melodrama. Divya Dutta, as Milkha's doting sister, and the only character in the film who appears to have never aged, hits all the predictable notes. Sonam Kapoor, meanwhile, in a smaller part, as Milkha's first love, brings a quiet freshness to her scenes. The film itself is well intentioned and shines a light on an important figure. But it's too long and too unfocused to leave a lasting impression. I'm going with two-and-a-half out of five for Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. Watch it for Farhan Akhtar's sincere performance.</Review>

      <Review Name="SUkanya Verma" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="12th July 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">You know the thing about unfortunate run-outs in cricket? Sometimes a batsman inching closer towards a knockout innings runs so eagerly in between wickets that by the time he gets on the other side, his off-guard co-batsman has not even started. Click! Although Bhaag Milkha Bhaag involves a completely different sport, the aforementioned scenario sits as an appropriate analogy to describe how Farhan Akhtar's zeal is let down by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's distracted story-telling. Legendary athlete Milkha Singh's life, on whom this feature is based, is truly inspiring and filled with a lot of exciting chapters that in the tradition of most biopics are dramatised and somewhat exaggerated to render it gripping and gritty. It's a filmmaker's call as to what extent he will intensify the actual with the imagined and haggle with style over substance. Sadly, in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Mehra goes overboard in his bid to look epic and promoting ad film aesthetics that focus on Farhan's remarkable physicality as he trains against Ladakh's majestic terrains, or swims in Australia's blue ocean with a pretty local in vintage swimwear or has recurring visions of the dreadful hour he witnessed the massacre of his folks that appear like a tacky VFX mash-up between Imran Khan's dreams in Jaane Tu...Yaa Jaane Naa and the dark, sepia-toned skies of Zack Snyder's 300. Mehra's comfort with histrionics infused Rang De Basanti with its hard-hitting rebellion but that was the whole point behind its story. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag fails to achieve that level of clarity or coherence, primarily because of Prasoon Joshi's faulty screenplay and sleepy editing by P Bharti, which appears both overwhelmed and clueless about putting together the many chapters of a sportsman's eventful existence. So Bhaag Milkha Bhaag adopts the contrived route wherein everyone competing with the titular hero is entirely nefarious and out to break his legs or bully him like those Rajput dudes in Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander and everything Pakistan implies hostile like those arrogant tyrants in every second jingoistic Bollywood flick. Moreover, this indecision to project Bhaag Milkha Bhaag as either a) a man dealing with the painful memories of his childhood in partition era, b) the blossoming of a happy-go-lucky army man into a superstar athlete or c) why an individual doesn't want to visit Pakistan overlaps too often in this three-hour plus, flashback-within-flashback drama to ruin a potentially promising premise. The last point, especially, makes no sense. It could be answered in the same breath that it was asked by K K Raina but poor Pawan Malhotra is handed the unpleasant task of recounting the entire story, including Milkha's fleeting romance (which has NOTHING to do with the query) and other digressions before the film reaches its extended finishing line. It's not that BMB is devoid of glorious moments. Milkha's camaraderie with his friends in the army, especially his doodh-chanting aspirations in a cross-country run, his ghee-feasting gusto outside the police chowki or his slap-filled outburst at himself after losing a race in Melbourne. Also, the portions with the younger Milkha (Japtej Singh) are quite memorable owing to this young actor's exuberant smile, effortless fervour boosted by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's roaring soundtrack and Binod Pradhan's beautiful frames, which nimbly change with the mood of its story. It's also a relief to see Prakash Raj in a role that's far less bombastic than what he usually does in Bollywood. Others like Malhotra, Raina, Divya Dutta (she exudes more emotion than all of BMB), provide the narrative its mandatory sighs and sobs but it's Dalip Tahil's uninspired, laughable casting as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru that truly baffles. There's also Sonam Kapoor with her carefully-styled messy hair in a role that lasts a few minutes. She's no gaon ki Punjaban but with such short screen time, there's little damage one can do. Ultimately, the only reason to watch this disappointment is Farhan Akhtar's career-best delivery. He visibly labours to acquire a stunning physicality, a body language that knows legs that run from legs that race and rinse off the urban texture of his personality to become the Flying Sikh who overcomes extraordinary battles -- of mind, body and society to emerge a victor. And he does, leaving everyone behind.</Review>

      <Review Name="Shubhra Gupta" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="13th July, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">Are you relaxing? No, I am Milkha Singh. This is one of those legendary jokes that typifies a couple of things: Punjabi humour in all its quirky broadness, and the man who is supposed to have said it, the legendary athlete who broke records on national and international tracks, and became a byword for sporting excellence in India. I've always thought the line was apocryphal. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's film, 'inspired by a true life' grounds the joke in a moment, and cements the tone of the film. Carefully skirting the tag of a bio-pic, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag manages to tell the story of Milkha Singh, as enacted by Farhan Akhtar, while giving us, tiresomely, all the familiar bells and whistles of a Bollywood entertainer with the naach-gaana, and the rona-dhona. The story of Milkha Singh is inspirational, doubtless. And Mehra leaves, literally, not one stone unturned (and adds a few of his own, doubtless) in this three hour and some saga, which takes us from Milkha's childhood in then Punjab-now Pakistan, the trauma of Partition and being torn from his (Milkha's) family, his lawless youth, his joining the Indian Army and gaining respectability. And then learning the joys of running. For himself, and for the honour of his nation. But the way the director tells it is much less inspiring. It's almost as if he needs to talk up his film in order to entice us to watch it. Why, you ask yourself, when you see a burst of sporting glory, the kind that becomes goose-flesh immortal every time someone refers to it even, does the director need to dress up his story so much that it nearly drowns? The face of a winner, at the end of a tough race, is such a win in itself. Is there any need to underline it, just in case we miss the point, with loud background music? When the film is left to tell the story unvarnished, it has several felt passages. And most of them belong to Milkha's childhood. Little Milkha and his plump friend, wading through a river, tossing a few lines between them as friends are wont to. His being made to be a murga in the tiny village school, and colloquial talk of his thui ( backside, reddening at the touch of a master's chhadi/stick). His strong love for older sister (Dutta) which keeps him going in adulthood. It is a strong segment, with Art Malik, playing Milkha's father, and who exhorts him to 'run', to flee to the other side of the newly formed, bloody border. In short order, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag starts getting overlaid by too much drama and mawkishness. Farhan Akhtar is consistently likeable but not always believable as the eponymous hero. He does everything he needs to: the liking for duddh (milk) that gets him to start the back-breaking training, his early attraction to a pretty Punjaban (Kapoor), the little flirtations he indulges in (one with a saucy Aussie girl in Melbourne), and then straining every sinew for a win. You can see Akhtar's hard work, both on his physique, and the way he runs on the track and field and everywhere else, as well as his accent. But the moment you place him alongside a Pawan Malhotra, who plays his Army coach, and who speaks Punjabi just the way it ought to be spoken, guttural, from the heart, that you know that difference between acting a part and the real deal. As the Indian athletics coach who accompanies Milkha in his latter journeys, Yograj Singh is effective. So is Prakash Raj as the stentorian, if a tad stereotypical, Army senior. Dutta, too, as the loving badi behen leaves a mark. Kapoor's presence, as the love angle, is mercifully brief. It is meant to be sweet, that little interlude, but you can see it for what it is, playacting. If the film had kept it pared, toning down the trumpets which blare every time something momentous is about to happen, it would have been a more powerful testament to an all-time sporting great. As it has turned out, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is more the overlong, overblown Singing-Dancing-Flying Sikh, than just the triumphal, true Flying Sikh.</Review>

Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, as the promos promised, essentially explores the man behind the phenomenon, considered one of the greatest Indian sportsmen ever. If Milkha is a living legend, his life brims with drama more audacious than any run-of-the-mill film script. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra creates fascinating fiction out of facts, although he could have kept it shorter. At 187 minutes, the film includes too many subplots to remain cohesive all through. Three-film-old Mehra's career so far has swung to and fro extremes. His first, Aks, defined confusion as did his last, Delhi-6. In between the two there was Rang De Basanti, a film that inspired a whole nation. The law of averages seems to work in Mehra's favour this time. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, aimed at inspiring through its story of an icon, shouldn't have much trouble impressing Bollywood buffs. The film draws its title from the last words Milkha as a boy heard from his father, in the wake of Partition riots. The communal violence of the era forms the fulcrum in laying out Milkha's formative phase. It hints at what went into creating the resilience of the man we would come to know as the Flying Sikh in the years to come. Milkha's story divides itself roughly into two halves. There is the restless, angered youth, coming to terms with Partition that cost him his family, and taking to crime as a refugee for sustenance. Then there is the spirited youth who gets into the Army, where his talent as a sprinter is first spotted. Prasoon Joshi's script moves in time cycles between past and present to set up the story of these two Milkhas. The salad days in the barracks provide an engaging watch. Joshi is vivid in imagination of Milkha's time in the Army. The element of camaraderie inherent in this early phase of his life leaves scope for random humour and emotions alike. The film could have done away with the imposed mush quota. Sonam Kapoor's 20-minute appearance as Milkha's 'romantic heroine' cuts down pace, as do his subsequent dalliances with an Australian girl (Rebecca Breeds, she gets an almost equal footage too). For a biopic mounted on a lavish 30-crore scale, those though are expected frills. Farhan has always scored as a natural, though mostly exuding urban cool in films such as Rock On!!, Luck By Chance and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. Playing Milkha lets him break the mould. He underplays every emotion to impress. Among the prop cast, Pavan Malhotra (as Milkha's first coach) and Divya Dutta (as his elder sister) steal the show despite small roles. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tries to inspire without getting too complex about it and succeeds. Just for that, it is worth a watch.</Review>

      <Review Name="Mansha Rastogi" Affiliation="nowrunning.com" Date="12th July, 2013" Likes="1" Expected="ThumbsDown">Sports films always rake in the moolah and build an instant connect with the masses. Take Chak De India for sample or even the exemplary Paan Singh Tomar. It's the perseverance of the lead protagonists, their strife for excellence and their indefatigable spirit that strikes a chord with people making the stories cult. However, the fact that you are making a biopic doesn't just work. It should be crisp, should be told with exact conviction with which the life of the protagonist was lived and only then it becomes a good film. Milkha Singh aka the Flying Sikh's biopic Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tries to achieve that excellence. Does it succeed? We tell you. It all starts from Milkha Singh losing the only race in his entire life, that in Rome, Olympics in 1960. We are then taken to the time when Milkha Singh has already attained the success that he set out to achieve. But he refuses to run if sent to Pakistan, the country he detests. Three people, two of Singh's coaches and a messenger of Pandit Jawaharwal Nehru are sent to convince Singh to take part. The story then moves into series of intercutting of past and present where the coaches narrate the reason why Milkha is against running in Pakistan. We all know that Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's (ROM) most ambitious venture BMB took almost two years for completion. We also know that Farhan Akhtar literally put his heart and soul in this project. But sadly, the film falls short in impressing even half as much as the efforts the latter has put. It's clearly ROM's flawed and extremely stretched story-telling that kills any thrill there ever could be in Milkha Singh's real life story. Moreover, the over-dramatization of episodes from Singh's life which actually don't contribute to the story at all makes matters worse. There are way too many episodes converted into numerous sub-plots narrated through a non-linear narrative pattern which actually don't just hog up the run time but also lead to a tiring film. Clocking three hours and eight minutes, BMB also gives you glimpses of Gadar, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar and Paan Singh Tomar, more like the latter for both the stories revolved around runners. So you have Milkha Singh taking part in athletics for Milk and Eggs and later finding it tough to adjust to shoes for he always ran bare feet clearly reminding you of Irrfan Khan of Paan Singh Tomar. To add to the agony are the songs used aplenty, much worse, some in slow motion which clearly are forced into the film without any relevance. The songs are jarring and definitely don't add value to the movie. Renowned cinematographer Binod Pradhan does a splendid job with the camera capturing certain sequences brilliantly however, it's ROM's drawback again for using those scenes in a gimmicky fashion. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag works only and only for Farhan Akhtar. The actor has raised the bar of acting to a whole new level and deserves to be lauded. Right from getting his physicality right to his diction, body language everything is remarkable. Sonam Kapoor on the other hand barely has much to do and even at that her sub-plot just consumes a lot of time. The rest of the cast like Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh, Dalip Tahil are passable. To sum it up, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an extremely dramatised, glossy version of a biopic which fails to connect owing to its extensive run time and exaggeration.</Review>

      <Review Name="Rajeev Masand" Affiliation="CNN IBN" Date="15th July, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsUp">Like 'Udaan', his feature debut from 2010, 'Lootera', directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, is exquisitely crafted. While Udaan was the coming of age tale of a small-town teenager going head to head with his despotic father, 'Lootera' is steeped in old-fashioned romance. At the heart of this film is a young couple faced with insurmountable odds. And yet, it isn't so much the film's story, but in its telling that Motwane woos you. Skillfully combining the key tools of cinema - pictures, sound, and music - he delivers a transcendent experience that's hard to describe in words. 'Lootera' opens in 1950s West Bengal, where a new democracy is changing archaic laws and reclaiming princely estates. Pakhi (Sonakshi Sinha) is the indulged daughter of an old zamindar (Barun Chanda) from Manekpur. She lives in a sheltered world, but you can see her straining for independence as she secretly drives the family car when she's out of her father's sight. Her world collides with that of archaeologist Varun (Ranveer Singh), who is invited to stay as a houseguest when he's on an assignment to excavate a site on her father's property. Varun and Pakhi are inexorably drawn to each other, even though he knows in his heart that he must leave her someday. The film's plot is inspired partly by O Henry's famous short story The Last Leaf, yet Motwane gives it a romantic, even thrilling twist. There is a lyrical quality to the couple's exchanges in 'Lootera'. Varun and Pakhi communicate with their eyes at the start, then their relationship deepens over shared dreams and long conversations. Pakhi confesses that she wants to be a writer, spinning stories in her Dalhousie home. Varun, in turn, has the soul of an artist and wishes to paint a masterpiece someday. The director establishes a leisurely pace that matches the period, and a picnic scene in particular, where the couple is gently teased by their friends, feels straight out of a Merchant-Ivory drama. In the second half, Motwane opts for muted colours and sticks with those interminably long silences as the couple is reunited under very different circumstances. There is attention to the smallest details in 'Lootera', like the art direction, the lighting, and particularly Mahendra Shetty's intuitive camera that knows just how to capture the lovely landscapes as well as the somber mood of later scenes. Amit Trivedi's beautiful songs and background score add another layer of feeling to the aching love story here. Yet it's hard to resign yourself to some convenient coincidences in the plot, or even the naivete that filters in towards the end. In a film so close to perfection, the small lapses are hard to hide. What you can't find fault in are the pitch-perfect performances. Barun Chanda deftly marries a father's vulnerability with the arrogance of a zamindar who believes he is entitled. Vikram Massey, playing Varun's Dev Anand-obsessed friend, is cheeky and unyielding in equal measure, while Adil Hussain does a good job as a hard-nosed cop on the heels of a criminal. Yet 'Lootera' belongs to its two leads, Ranveer Singh and Sonakshi Sinha, who do their best work here. Shifting seamlessly from feisty to fragile to bitter, Sonakshi delivers a deeply heartfelt performance that feels mature beyond her years. Ranveer, for his part, brings a quiet sensitivity to Varun, and occasionally a smoldering intensity. Offering a finely internalized performance, he leaves a lasting impression. Moving without resorting to melodrama, 'Lootera' is bittersweet in the end. Formerly an assistant to Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Motwane reveals the same command over technique, and a similar love for sweeping visuals. But unlike Bhansali's recent films, Motwane never distracts you with his tapestry. I'm going with four of five for 'Lootera'. Drop whatever else you're doing, and soak in this love saga.</Review>

      <Review Name="SHubhra Gupta" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="6th July, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">I should have watched Lootera backwards, because it finishes with an almost unbearable loveliness. The ache in the heart comes as a welcome relief, but a little too late. The journey towards the end is shot through with beauty, one painterly frame after another evoking admiration, but it did not touch me. And that is where Vikramaditya Motwane's film becomes a disappointing second act, after his magnificent debut Udaan. Lootera, set in the early '50s, tells the story of Varun (Singh) and Pakhi (Sinha) in a manner most Indian filmmakers have forgotten. Motwane knows how to pace his tale to match an old-wordly tempo: it is a unhurried build-up of time and place that takes you to the village of Manikpur in West Bengal in 1953, poised at the grand lifestyle of the zamindars about to go bust, and slides you into the opulent bubble that the local zamindar ( Chanda) and his daughter Pakhi live in. The arrival of the young, personable Varun and his companion (Massey) to set up an archeological dig around the haveli brings the first fissures. You can see why the motherless Pakhi, who has found solace only in her father's doting arms till now, will gravitate towards Varun. But I did not feel any reciprocal heat from Varun. He has his reasons for keeping his distance, because he is not who he claims he is. But when there is youth and passion, all reason flees. She shows her longing clearly. From him, you want more, not unreadable sidelong glances, and a stealing away when no one is looking. The main hook that should have kept you with them, is missing. The first half, which should have been the dance of desire between these two people, is impacted by this inexplicable remoteness. Varun's back story, with a no-good uncle (Zakaria), is clunkily done, and there are entire stretches where you are disconnected. The story, post half time, catches traction, and for me becomes the film. Almost. Time has elapsed. From a huge haveli with countless rooms, Pakhi has now moved to a small family guesthouse in Dalhousie, having lost her father, and other treasures that cocooned her during her growing up years. As she struggles with heartbreak, and a terminal illness (the kind that brings blood to a handkerchief, such an old-timey disease), Varun comes back to her life, and that takes both to the brink. Post interval, you can see better the influence of the great O'Henry short story (The Last Leaf), on which it is based. It is a more intimate canvas, and you finally see two lovers striving towards each other, breaths mingling. The bit parts, played by a cop (Hussain) who is after the fleet-footed Varun, and the housekeeper (Dutta) of the guesthouse, remain bit parts. The cop is responsible for an implausible plot point, which seems to be put in there to allow Singh to loosen up and show his feelings, both to the girl he had left behind, and to us. As the film quickens, so do we: Motwane is in form here, as he gives us doomed lovers spiraling out of control, leading to a memorable climax. But I wish Singh had been freed up more. His slate is bland. Much of the first half of the film is too, being revved up by its background music. The good parts of the film can be divvied up between cinematograher Mahendra Shetty's wizardry with the camera, the terrific, spot-on Barun Chanda, and Sonakshi Sinha. She plays Pakhi with surety, even when her eyes are too heavily ringed denoting sickness, channeling her emotions without holding back, allowing herself to get ugly while weeping. She is the real looteri; her Lootera should have had more heft. So should have the film. It has left me with some indelible scenes which are sheer poetry, but this is one of those films that I wanted to like much more than I did.</Review>

      <Review Name="Raja Sen" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="4rth July, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsUp">"Once upon a time." Those are four magic words, four words that promise us the world, adventure and romance and fantasy and drama. The starter's pistol to any fairytale, they offer up immediate escape: "a time" is never now, you see, and we're instantly whisked away from the humdrum of our everyday. Our imagination, like a suddenly alert hound, perks up its ears and begins to underscore even ordinary narratives with flourishes the narrator never spells out. With those four words in place, anything can follow. Vikramaditya Motwane understands this well, which is why his masterful adaptation of a classic O Henry story, nearly a hundred years old, begins with a father caressing a daughter with far older folklore. As the ailing daughter listens, the story snaps a character's neck, and the bassline in her head begins to thrum. Lootera makes it crystal clear right from the start that it is an old-world tale -- one involving buried treasure, no less, and rhymes about lizards and rats -- and then, with its sleeves rolled up, begins to enchant. The film opens gently, with a cough. The girl is a writer, the daughter of a Bengali zamindar -- naturally she'd have studied at Shantiniketan? That's what the boy rightly assumes, popping into her path as an archaeologist, but now shoehorned into her service as an art teacher. He pretends, she indulges, and one thing leads inevitably to another until we come thudding across to that heartbreaking finale we inaccurately thought we'd braced ourselves for. An exquisite but hard-to-translate word in Bengali called "aadikheta" means, in my clumsy approximation, an appetite for being pampered (worded as if pampering were a sweetmeat), and I can think of no better word for Motwane's heroine, Pakhi. A feisty girl who has largely been bred on affection by her doting father, her intelligence doesn't get in the way of her wondering, during the abolition of zamindari in the early 1950s, just what the government will do by seizing their gardens. So used is she to having her way that when a man thwarts her overtures, the feeling of rejection is too unfamiliar to register. Instead, she is merely confounded. Click! Her fellow, Varun, is a more street-smart sort, one who might not watch a film as soon as it releases but knows enough to cheekily make a reference to it later. When we first meet him, he's calm, unhurried and mostly unflappable -- playing an art-teacher might be a stretch for him, however. Nevertheless, he gamely calls drawing leaves easy, and confidently daubs at the canvas with green paint. The contrast between the two characters is delightful, and the actors conjure up a fierce, throbbing chemistry. Sonakshi Sinha plays Pakhi beautifully, creating a character who is immaculately wide-eyed and possesses casual, yet unmistakable, grace. It is a performance that starts off dreamily soft and turns harder, and she does well-etched dialogue justice like few actresses can. There's a discernible vulnerability to Pakhi throughout the film, and Sinha brings out this fragility perfectly without ever overplaying it. Ranveer Singh matches her step for step, using his lower lip to marvelous effect. He curls it when angry, juts it out when thoughtful and lets it hang loose (and, finally, frostbitten) when he has nothing to say. And again, he plays it close to the chest, never straying from the pitch of the film: when he stammers on the word "landscape", he lightly labours the L instead of actually repeating it. He looks good as a quiet pinup, a vintage hero in high-waisted trousers, but it is when he bedraggedly lets his seams show that Singh is at his best. He even snarls like Heathcliff. And despite all this proficiency with dialogue -- which extends to the other great performers in the film, the veteran Barun Chanda (who uses words like "umartaraaz" with near-Utpal Dutt gravitas) and the very likable Vikrant Massey, who throws in a Devsaab impression -- the very best moments in Lootera are the entirely wordless ones. This is largely due to the remarkable craft shown by cinematographer Mahendra J Shetty, who has composed a film where every frame melts into the other with a most lyrical ebb and flow. Lootera is a gorgeous, gorgeous film, one that uses its period setting affectionately, with loving detail, and not exploitatively, as our cinema is wont to do. Shetty pores over it all -- from the lace curtains to the mosquito nets, from the checkerboard floors of the old mansion to the frozen-over remnants of a roadside shrine to a dashboard light surrounded by open-air darkness -- but the way he frames his actors' faces may be the greatest masterclass on offer. Both Sinha and Singh have distinctive noses, and rather than divert attention away from them the film embraces the contrast, highlighting it by a profile shot of the two in the same frame. Before we encounter Sonakshi's nose we see that of a Durga effigy, and the uniqueness of the actress' nose is thrown automatically into sharp relief. Later, when Sinha's angry, the lens is positioned to make her nose look like a menhir; it's always intentional, and it's always captivating. Singh's is a more angular nose, one that looks pointy as sweat drips off it during a dimly lit-scene, and the first time the two kiss, it is preceded by an eskimo-style rubbing of the noses. Many cinematographers can conjure up moody shadows and beautiful frames, but what is on show here -- as Sinha looks through a big magnifying glass to make her eyes appear huge, as the Bengali-girl stereotype dictates -- is so much more special, and Shetty is clearly a wizard. All this while Motwane plays The Thieving Magpie. And I don't just mean the Rossellini overture that automatically reminds me of The Castafiore Emerald. Lootera deftly pays tribute to Guru Dutt's first film by way of song and name of the villain, and borrows a disease from Ritwik Ghatak's heartwrenching Meghe Dhaka Tara. All this while genius composer Amit Trivedi uncharacteristically steals his main theme from a bad English film, as if some pickpocketry was the price of entry. In light of what the titular protagonist does, perhaps this adaptation could be titled The Last Thief. Either way, this is a film worth the grandest of larceny. Motwane's direction is so assured and confident that this scarcely feels like his second feature. The script is clearly one he believes in, and the film is resultantly free of false-notes. Even the few moments that feel like narrative missteps turn out to be masterstrokes. And, as exemplified by a breathtaking chase sequence that could result in any number of outcomes, Motwane sides with his story, not with any one of his characters. A film, then, about life, love and leaves. And in the end it comes down to the sort of snow-surrounded tree that you can draw even if you've always had trouble drawing leaves. Magnificent.</Review>

      <Review Name="Karan Anshuman" Affiliation="Mumbai Mirror" Date="5th July, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsUp***">An O Henry short story is the spark that ignites a cinematic interpretation that undoubtedly would leave even the celebrated writer dazzled, if unaffected. Director Vikramaditya Motawane has constructed an elaborate experiment of a film. A big-budget visual delight starring A-list actors, Lootera's story is simplistic; it's telling self-consciously un-Bollywood, and one that aspires for artistic glory. Set in early post-independence Bengal and Himachal, Lootera is a elaborately dressed but subdued love story of an "archaeologist" and a zamindar's daughter whose father's highbred legacy is struggling to keep with the changing times. The story has much scope for drama but Motwane and co-writer Bhavani Iyer choose to shy away, holding back on the exuberance and elements of surprise (often allowing the audience to be ahead of the characters) and allowing tenderness to take over tautness. The humor is intrinsic, a lot of dialogue is distilled to whispers. While the first half is unhurried and replete with stolen glances, chases across snowy hill stations and some decisive action breathes some life into the the second. Expectedly, the title itself foretells revelations. This subtle film instructs you in a not-so-subtle manner: watch it for its moments (of which there are several), not for what happens next (convenience looms large, cracks are duct-taped over). You are not to be bogged down by logic. Motwane has taken more than a cue from Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the extravagant director he's assisted for over half a decade, and has drawn from his sense of aesthetic in Lootera. This is a purposive choice for a director who has now shown commendable range considering his excellent first film Udaan, as raw an indie can get. And yet similarities between the two films abound. Poignant moments are created by simply not thrusting Bollywood methodology in the filmmaking. Note for example how plot is secondary, it's the characters we're made to invest in. We're sympathetic to their effort to evince their internal battles in words in actions, both that are often knowingly repetitive and yet not jarring. Ranvir Singh and Sonakshi Sinha are at their subtle best with every line of dialog, every expression acutely considered. And yet eventually the film overwhelms the performances. Because the craftsmanship, if anything, is even more impeccable. The highlights of Lootera, the overwhelming reason you may choose to watch this film, lie in the technical departments. There is a sense of purity in Mahendra Shetty's cinematography, luscious with light, undaunted by grain in the dark. A timbre in Kunal Sharma's sound design, especially the way the dialog tracks have been treated, is reminiscent of watching older films in a time before 5.1 (I truly hope this is was intentional and not a result of a bad speaker in the theater I watched it). And finally, Aditya Kanwar's art direction. What startling recreation of period! What incredible attention to detail! Lootera superbly uses technique to immerse you in the period. As much as I'd like to reward Lootera for it's craft I firmly believe that films can only win you over with the ability to tell a story. And this is where Lootera falters. It allows you to drift away. And this is why Udaan, despite struggling on the technical front with its 16 mm camera and stark walls, will always be an exceptional and better film.</Review>

      <Review Name="ASeem Chabra" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="5th  July, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsUp">How do two people fall in love? When do they first realize it is love and not just infatuation or physical attraction? In life we often wonder if it is real love that we feel for another person or an emotion with another name. So we seek wisdom of wiser people -- writers, musicians and even filmmakers to guide us through that sense, since real life results in more confusion. In Vikramaditya Motwane�s sophomore project Lootera, the sense of love happens the first time his protagonists -- Pakhi (Sonakshi Sinha), the daughter of a landlord and Varun (Ranveer Singh), an archeologist with a mysterious agenda, are involved in a road accident. Pakhi is learning to drive a car on a small rural road and as she looks away she hits a very James Dean-like (although he also reminded me of Gael Garcia Bernal�s Che Guevara in The Motorcycle Diaries) Varun, on a motorcycle. Motwane�s protagonists fall in love in a very quiet way. The director textures into his narrative many parting glances, slight conversations and playful flirtations -- often aided by Amit Trivedi�s seductive score. For Pakhi this is clearly love. It may be her first, but she knows it. But Varun struggles with the ghosts of his past and is driven by the grey shades of his character. When Pakhi confronts Varun, and begs him to acknowledge that he also loves her, he keeps quiet. Love is not easy for him. There is too much holding him back and he cannot say yes even if it is just to please Pakhi, who is clearly hurting. That is such a heartbreakingly beautiful moment in Lootera -- a rare experience in Bollywood films, where love is usually tossed loudly at the audience with a Khulam Khulla Pyar Karenge attitude. In Lootera, Pakhi�s pain at that moment is no less than that of Satyajit Ray�s Charulata when she realizes that her love for Amal will never be fully realised. Motwane�s Lootera (a very fine follow-up to his outstanding Udaan) is lovely film, a blessing for fans of Bollywood who seek real, relatable characters, a meaningful story, a narrative that takes them on a romantic journey, filled with a lot of joy and balanced with some much needed sense of heartache. It is a mature film, but it is also very entertaining -- if that is the sole criteria that drive many of the audiences to thetares to watch Hindi films. Lootera is inspired by O Henry�s slim, 2,500-word long, Greenwich Village-based short story, The Last Leaf. Motwane and his co-writer Bhavani Iyer weave a more detailed and complex narrative around the short story, finely etching out a romance and lace it with a crime that will test the film�s overriding theme of love. There is one peculiar and hard to believe coincidence in the second half of Lootera, but by then I was too much in love with the film to really worry about it. Just two films old, Motwane shows the experience of a filmmaker who could have been making films for many years. Lootera is a period piece -- first half set in rural Bengal in the early 1950s and the second in a cold, grey and snowy Dalhousie. Motwane�s investment in the details -- the cars, the furniture and other artifacts in a Bengali landlord�s house, the costumes and the look of his characters becomes a part of his narrative. His players -- especially Sinha and Singh look like people from that era, very comfortable with their appearances and their surroundings. Singh gives a controlled performance, acting with his smile, eyes, using a low voice and remarkably subduing the tremendous energy the actor has portrayed in his first two films and also displays in his public appearances. Sinha is the real surprise in the film, giving such a fine nuanced performance. As Pakhi she is a young, na�ve dreamer whose heart is first stolen and later broken by a mysterious man. How does the 26-year-old who has appeared in films like Dabangg and Rowdy Rathore become the utterly charming Pakhi in Lootera? Definitely director Motwane has a lot do with that. The songs with Amit Trivedi�s compositions set to Amitabh Bhattacharya�s lyrics are playful (Sawaar Loon) and tragic (the soul of the film Ankahee), and they stay with you long after the film is over. Trivedi is one of the few musicians in Hindi cinema who really knows how to create a meaningful background score -- not in your face loud deafening sounds, but music that eases the audience through the film�s romantic journey. Lootera is a gift, wrapped beautifully in a box, with enough rewards that remind us why we like films in the first place.</Review>

      <Review Name="Rajeev Masand" Affiliation="CNN IBN" Date="29th June,2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">The mystery in 'Ghanchakkar' involves the whereabouts of a suitcase containing stolen cash. Yet, a harder puzzle to crack is figuring out just how so many talented people could make such a disappointing film. 'No One Killed Jessica' director Raj Kumar Gupta recruits a competent cast, but flounders with a half-cooked script that doesn't know where to go after setting up its delicious premise. Sanju (Emran Hashmi) is a retired cat burglar-turned-full time couch potato who's goaded by his pushy wife Neetu (Vidya Balan) into participating in one last job. What follows is a terrific bank robbery scene involving a security guard and a matka kulfi, the inventive use of movie-star masks, and the unscheduled arrival of a cop who almost foils the plan. Nevertheless, Sanju and his two accomplices - Pandit (Rajesh Sharma) and Idrees (Namit Das) - make off with Rs 35 crore in loot. The entire cash is left with Sanju for the next three months, until the heat from the crime dies down. But when the two goons return to claim their share, they discover Sanju has lost his memory in an accident, and can't remember either them or where he's hidden the bounty. 'Ghanchakkar' has all the ingredients for a dark comedy, yet shaken and stirred they blend like oil and water. The storytelling itself is inconsistent. The plot hits the ground running, never spoon-feeding you with background information you don't need. Then, when the two goons move into the couple's flat while Sanju struggles with his amnesia, you have a set-up ripe for laughs. But Gupta squanders this potential with one too many dinner table scenes banging on about the same joke involving Neetu's cooking. Frustration sets in during the film's flabby middle portion where nothing much really happens. The angry goons want their money...Sanju can't remember a thing...He chases clues that lead nowhere...They bash the living daylights out of him. This routine is repeated over and over again till the line: "Paise kahan hain?" becomes embedded in your brain like a pesky metal chip! And well before it's ultimately revealed in film's the climax, you've guessed the suspense already. It's all such a shame because some things work nicely. The local train becomes an unlikely 'conference room' where the goons hatch their plans, and a running joke about a vegetable-bearing commuter is genuinely funny. The cast too, hits all the right notes. Vidya Balan offers a particularly uninhibited performance as the garrulous, fashion-disaster of a housewife; the kind of part few leading ladies would venture near, or competently pull off. Emraan Hashmi is suitably befuddled, but struggles to shine under the limited scope of his role. The two leads slip easily into the shoes of a couple stuck in a humdrum marriage. As the desperate goons slowly losing their patience, Rajesh Sharma and Namit Das are first-rate. An unlikely team, Sharma's manner is almost polite as the older Pandit, while Namit Das turns Idrees into a hot-headed, trigger-happy lout. In one scene that goes from icky to whacky, we watch as Idrees, midway through a raunchy phone call, ups and chases after Sanju in his underwear. These inspired moments then are few and far between in this lazily scripted film that leaves you bored and searching for the nearest exit. I'm going with two out of five for 'Ghanchakkar'. The money is found in the end, but that's 2 hours and 17 minutes of your life that you'll never see again!</Review>

      <Review Name="Shubhra Gupta" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="29th June,2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">Horny woman who doesn't bother hiding it plus dour man with a secret, has the potential to be a humdinger. Ghanchakkar sets up trying-to-go-straight safe-breaker Sanju, and his blowsy trying-to-be fashion-forward wife Neetu, and a couple of rogues, around a bank heist, and lets them loose. This could have been a hoot, but the execution lets down the premise, and the film remains one of those that could have been edgier and funnier. It isn't that Emraan and Vidya, playing the married couple squabbling over minor things, are not given a few laugh-out-loud situations. Raj Kumar Gupta, who's done Aamir and No One Killed Jessica before this, gives Sanjay and Neetu a cracking opening, involving bad cooking, resigned eating, and spousal sulks. Post the dining, there is the bedding. And here, where very few Bollywood movies venture with any imagination, the director gifts us an occasional smile. Balan wears wicked red horns and fishtail tights with flourish: she's all bondage hot-and-ready, and Hashmi who usually gets to kiss and leave his lovelies, lets her make the first move. Two shady fellows, Pandit (Sharma) and Idris (Das), enter their placid lives, enticing Sanju to get back to his tools and a bank vault stuffed with a great deal of cash. The booty, stashed in a suitcase, disappears. The rest of the film has these four characters searching for it, shooting suspicious glances at each other, being stymied by dead ends. This is where the film could have quickened, but it slackens instead, leaving Balan to provide a chuckle or two in her hatti katti Punjaban avatar, her accent slipping more than her deeply cut negligees. But the film doesn't make of its characters' quirks as much as it could have. The Sharma-Das duo has some moments, but is essentially flat. Pretty much like a running gag that starts out funny and ends up as an eye-glaze. And that leads me to a question: are four characters too few (there are a couple of others who show up for a scene or two, but it is with the foursome that all the action rests) for a two hour film? Like some spouses who need additional spice to keep interest from flagging, the unexpected appearance of an extra character perks up the film, and gives us a near-rousing end. Nice wrap, making you wish the rest of the film was as sharp.</Review>

      <Review Name="Karan Anshuman" Affiliation="Mumbai Mirror" Date="28th June,2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">Director Raj Kumar Gupta's previous efforts Aamir and No One Killed Jessica had a couple of traits in common. First, a deftly written and executed set up that draws you into the film and at mid-point leaves you wanting a lot more but eventually lets you down. Second, exceptional handling of the actors to get exactly what he wants out of them. Take NOKJ for example. The film's second half lacks the tension its subject so desperately requires even though every time she is on screen, Rani Mukerji vitalizes the narrative and carries her over-the-top character with the kind of pizzazz that few other actors would've been able to pull off. Ghanchakkar stumbles similarly. It all begins with an odd, animated title sequence that in hindsight, after the film, seems like a meaningless slapdash effort. But the first half soon puts the mood in order with some hilarious sequences (a hat-tip to Point Break's bank robbery, is the funniest of the lot) and a decent plot (involving a heist, a suitcase full of cash, and memory loss) that keeps the audience guessing how it's going to end. The red herrings are handled dexterously and at every turn, just when you think Gupta's going to cheat you by revealing a new side to his characters, he keeps them true and rock steady. However, this victimizes the script and Gupta paints himself into a corner with no out and ends up botching the third act. He meanders, wastes time visualizing the obvious, and refuses to get a move on by throwing in situation after situation that only serve to widen, not propel the premise. Perhaps he could've started with more characters to play with rather than the four we're focused on, for the majority of the time based in one apartment. Sure, Gupta eventually takes the story to a place you don't expect, but is this a satisfying end? I didn't think so. Because this entire construct, this choice of subject, hinges more on the destination rather than the journey, the sense of loss is even greater. And if there's a deeper layer to this film, I'm missing it. Vidya Balan is in self-deprecating mode and hats off to her to be so in your face about it in Bollywood town. Not only is she twice Emraan Hashmi's width, she dresses up and accessorizes in the most outlandish manner. Since her character Neetu never steps out of her house, the Punjaban's "ultra-modern, fashionable" taste is sourced from a slew of fashion magazines. Her relationship with her husband Sanju is far more complex than what you usually see in Hindi movies. If there is love, there is also lack of salt at dinner; if there is understanding, there is also mistrust. Hashmi interprets his part - Sanju has to deal with more confusion than conviction - with no difficulty. He is no hero either, often getting thrashed by his live-in goons (cast and essayed well by Rajesh Sharma and Namit Das) and not retaliating. After this third film, one can only surmise that Gupta gets enthused with some terrific ideas and heads straight for the shooting floor without thinking them through entirely. Ghanchakkar is all very well as it flags off, but it's mostly downhill after it hits its high point in the first fifteen minutes.</Review>

      <Review Name="Raja Sen" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="28th June,2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown">The finest, most fascinating mysteries are the ones where we find the red herrings stashed away in plain sight all along. In Raj Kumar Gupta's Ghanchakkar, the true clue to the proceedings is barely hidden. It's in the song playing in every trailer, the song over the opening credits of the film: it's fiendishly smart to say Lazy Lad and make us assume the filmmakers are talking about the protagonist when in reality they mean the screenwriter. For this is a confoundingly half-written film. Click! What is exasperating is how good it is right up to the third act, right up to the point when the people plotting this clever and twisty story decided not to type out any more ideas and let the film remain an almighty mess. Like all of Gupta's films, it starts brilliantly. Emraan Hashmi's Sanju lives with his wife Neetu (Vidya Balan) who dresses like a backup dancer in an 80s music video and doesn't have a knack for seasoning food. One evening, over a plateful of something too salted, a mysterious man calls with a very lucrative offer. Sanju, who insists they have enough saved up for a few years of idling, isn't keen but Neetu nudges him towards that classic 'one last job.' This leads to a hilarious bank robbery, one that makes dazzling use of celebrity masks that I would hate to ruin by telling you about, but it's like a Hrishikesh Mukherjee version of Point Break. Each mask wears a different expression -- a Grin, a Gasp and a Frown -- and the way these famous faces fumble their way through the chaos is priceless. The film rollickingly (and with very impressive narrative economy) zips through its constantly compelling story, and in less than a half hour we know all our principal protagonists, have seen a great robbery, and are aware that one of them has lost his memory and thus forgotten, three months later -- when the cash is meant to be divvied up -- where the loot lies. So far so far-out, and Gupta and his fine ensemble cast fill in the details with wonderful whimsy. The reliably excellent Rajesh Sharma plays an unctuous baddie called Pandit, a great contrast to his profane and trigger-happy partner, Idris (Namit Das), while Hashmi looks appropriately befuddled and Balan, from amid a deluge of polka dots, sparkles in that way only she can. I think I smiled at the screen throughout the madcap first half, the lunacy of which echoed early Coen Brothers movies. (I was particularly reminded of Raising Arizona.) Balan, in particular, deserves to be singled out for applause simply because of her willingness as a leading lady to take on a role this farcical -- that of a loud character not just overweight but mocked for her weight, through dialogue and ludicrous costume. There is a scene, I kid you not, where she wears giant earrings shaped like prisoners, as if The Beagle Boys were using her ears for clotheslines. But despite all the merry tomfoolery, a film like Ghanchakkar depends more on the meat of the story than on its execution. And somewhere through the second half, it stops being funny and becomes inane precisely at the time when it should have showed off its intelligence. We look for a big reveal and there is none. And a house of cards can't be built on jokers alone. So despite the delicious nuances -- the sabzee-buying commuter; the roadside apothecary with technicolor bottles; a chipmunk-like crook talking naughty on the phone before, without irony, straddling the film's hero -- Ghanchakkar builds up and builds up and builds up magnificently before collapsing in a bloody silly heap. I was loving this film till it turned the tables and cheated me. Maybe, like the television-addicted Sanju, we're all better off watching these films on Zee Cinema. At least we can change channels or fall asleep midway.</Review>

      <Review Name="Saibai Chatterjee" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="27th June,2013" Likes="50" Expected="ThumbsDown">The odd-couple pairing of Emraan Hashmi and Vidya Balan apart, this madcap whirligig has little on offer by way of innate allure. The fundamental concept of Ghanchakkar is intriguing all right, but it simply isn�t sturdy enough to bear the weight of an entire two hour-plus film. It presses a 1980s plot device into the service of what is meant to be a new age comic thriller and inevitably comes a cropper. Three guys pull off a bank heist, one of the robbers suffers a memory loss, and the booty goes missing. The pace of this black comedy is so somnolent that all the characters, and not just the �lazy lad� of the film�s quirky opening song, appear to be sleepwalking through it all. What makes the film worse is that none of the handful of players is a rounded figure that the audience can relate to. This film about a man�s lost yaadasht and the complications that it sparks off seems destined to be quickly forgotten. Ghanchakkar, if it is remembered at all, will go down as an ill-advised change of pace for Raj Kumar Gupta, the maker of the memorable Aamir and No One Killed Jessica. At the heart of Ghanchakkar are a couch potato (Emraan Hashmi) who is an all but retired cat burglar and his garrulous wife (Vidya Balan) who has a fetish for strappy nightwear. The loquacious lady�s antics in the bedroom are only mildly diverting and the listless lumbering of the spaced-out man that she shares the apartment with does not help matters. The hubby, after much prodding, decides to accept the tempting offer of one final job from a duo of small-time goons. One is an avuncular and glib conspirator (Rajesh Sharma) and a jaunty young accomplice (Namit Das) given to brandishing his revolver at the slightest provocation. The trio plots the bank robbery in a midnight meeting in a compartment of a local train. At the appointed hour, the three men, wearing Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra and Utpal Dutt masks, raid and loot the bank. The safecracker is given the responsibility of hiding the stash of cash until the heat is off. Three months and an unspecified accident later, the male protagonist, struck by amnesia, has no remembrance of where he has kept the money. The rigmarole that ensues revolves around the hero�s struggle to recall exactly what he did that night and his two angry accomplice�s desperate attempts to get their share of the plunder. Despite its surprise ending, Ghanchakkar fails to engage. It is overstretched, flimsy and ineffectual. The screenplay (credited to Parveez Shaikh and director Raj Kumar Gupta) stutters along without much purpose. The characters are half-baked and aren�t given any context at all. Especially feckless is the figure of the hausfrau who reads Vogue and Cosmo for fashion inspiration and then goes and dons the most outlandish of outfits. Neither the husband nor the audience is inveigled. The lady is Punjabi, so she is cheerfully robust and adds a shrill haayn to the end of every sentence to convey a wide range of emotions, from bewilderment to indignation. And, needless to say, her �minute� is �mint�, her bharosa is bhrosa, and her galat is galt. In the ultimate analysis, she is hardly worth the salt that she wastes on her inept cooking. The two criminals who drag the couple into trouble are no better. The screenplay provides no insight into where they have come from and what they are up to. Not that anybody cares. As for the hero, he has a valid excuse for making a fool of himself. He is after all out of his mind � and depth. Ghanchakkar tries very, very hard to raise a few laughs. You might hear a chuckle here and a giggle there, but the comic situations are far too laboured to leave a lasting impression. In a film about a man who has lost his memory, an allusion to Ghajini is inevitable. At the dinner table, where much of the film plays out, one guy declares that it is a Salman Khan film, another believes that it featured Shahrukh Khan, while a third passes it off as a Saif Ali Khan starrer. Would Aamir be amused? In another scene, the hero orders red wine on the phone. The voice at the other end of the line wants to know where the bottle has to be delivered. The poor bloke is stumped. He steps out of the door to check the number of his flat, then goes all the way down to the main gate to read the name of the housing society, and finally walks a little further to ascertain what the street is called. Funny? Hardly. Ghanchakkar is strictly for those that are easy to tickle and shock. One character, the one with the gun, sums it up best: �I don�t know what is going on and who is taking whom for a ride.� Heed the warning!</Review>

      <Review Name="Anupama Chopra" Affiliation="Hindustan Times" Date="21st  June,2013" Likes="0" Expected="ThumbsUp">Let me begin with an honest confession. As I drove to the preview theatre to watch Raanjhanaa, I wondered how I would spend over two hours gazing at a hero as plain as Dhanush. Until this film, I had only seen the National Award-winning actor in his blockbuster Kolaveri Di video. But my fears vanished almost as soon as the film started because in the first few minutes, Dhanush�s character Kundan jokingly acknowledges his lack of good looks. And after the first 10 minutes, I was utterly bowled over by Dhanush�s energy and charm. He�s outstanding as the spirited, street-smart son of a pundit in Benares who is a little boy when he embarks on his epic love story. The object of his passion is the local Muslim beauty, Zoya played by Sonam Kapoor. This is a love so ferocious that eventually it consumes everything in its path. But for the first half, it�s also superbly entertaining. Kundan chases Zoya with the ardour of a true devotee. She is artfully careless with his emotions but he doesn�t miss a beat. The pursuit continues for years. So much so that at one point, Kundan�s closest friend Murari, played by the terrific Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub, remarks: �Pyaar na hua, UPSC ka imtihan ho gaya. Dus saal se paas hi nahi ho raha.� The dialogues by Himanshu Sharma are the highlight of the film. The lines are pithy, earthy and wonderfully funny. Snaking his camera through the streets of Benares, director Aanand L Rai creates an intimate and lived milieu. AR Rahman�s music, especially the gorgeous Tum Tak, layers the narrative further. This love story is fantastical but these are characters we could know. Their emotions move us � so much so that when Kundan finally breaks down and cries, I wept too. But this is where Raanjhanaa gets frustrating. Rai hits a false note as soon as the story shifts to Zoya�s romance with her college friend, Akram, played by Abhay Deol. And post-interval, when we leave Benares for New Delhi, the film derails considerably. The actors still move us � including Sonam who looks effortlessly beautiful and gives her career�s best performance � but the plot becomes more and more convoluted. You are neither immersed in the film nor removed from it. So, basically, I was crying without being convinced by the half-baked political twists and turns of the story. Unfortunately, Raanjhanaa never fully gets back on track. But despite these flaws, I�m recommending that you see it. Especially for Dhanush who proves that eventually looks don�t matter. Neither does size. All that towers is talent.</Review>

      <Review Name="Rajeev Masand" Affiliation="CNN IBN" Date="28th June,2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsUp">A good way to measure the success of a love story is to ask yourself how much you want its protagonists to end up together. 'Raanjhanaa' is about a young Hindu boy in Benares and his unwavering love for a Muslim girl who doesn't see him as anything more than a friend. From the moment we're first introduced to them as children - him dressed as Shiva, her performing namaaz - it becomes clear there can be no love story here. Yet, Kundan (Dhanush) has been crazy about Zoya (Sonam Kapoor) ever since they were little. Convinced she'll change her mind, he pursues her relentlessly...throughout their school years, and well after she returns from Delhi on completing college, unaware that she's already in love with a boy she met on campus (Abhay Deol in a cameo). 'Tanu Weds Manu' director Anand Rai exploits the vibrancy of the holy city, and yet gives us a lived-in feel of Benares, rather than taking the typical travel-brochure approach. He banks as much on the unmistakable charm of his leading man to deliver a terrific first hour that breezes by with plenty comic moments and some genuinely heartfelt scenes. Kundan's obsessive pursuit of Zoya is nothing short of stalking. Equally disconcerting is the idea that the filmmakers would endorse slashing one's wrists as a way to profess love. Yet, truth is, these scenes don't necessarily ring untrue in the film's spot-on depiction of small-town India and its Bollywood-bred youth. The script unfortunately goes off the rails in the film's second half, when the story shifts to the JNU campus in Delhi, where our protagonists put romance on the backburner and busy themselves with active politics. Some interesting ideas, inspired by real-life current affairs, are explored here - the formation of a citizen's party, the clash between corruption and idealism, and the oppression of the rural class - but despite the filmmakers' best intentions, this track doesn't fit seamlessly into the larger narrative. If there's one reason 'Raanjhanaa' doesn't entirely disappoint in spite of its problems, it's Dhanush, who offers an uninhibited performance that's hard to take your eyes off. A National Award winning actor in Tamil cinema, Dhanush slips into the skin of Kundan and owns the part. He's complemented ably by Sonam Kapoor, who does some of her best work here, going smoothly from innocent to manipulative to cynical, without ever losing Zoya's inherent vulnerability. The film also benefits from two solid supporting players: Swara Bhaskar, superb as Kundan's childhood friend Bindiya, who pines for him unashamedly. And No One Killed Jessica's Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub as Kundan's best friend Murari, whose rat-a-tat lines provide some of the best laughs. For its immensely entertaining first half, a winning score by AR Rahman, but most of all for Dhanush, this is a film that's worth your time. I'm going with three out of five for Raanjhanaa. It's not perfect, but it'll do.</Review>

      <Review Name="Sukanya Verma" Affiliation="Rediff" Date="21st June,2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown***">When a man loves a woman, can�t keep his mind on nothing else.� The Percy Sledge classic sums the spirit of Aanand L Rai�s new romance to perfection. In Raanjhanaa, a guy from Benares tests his owns limits to the extent he�ll go for the girl he�s been besotted by ever since he was a little boy. Endeavours that begin this early have a way of getting out of hand and exasperating. But Rai has Dhanush -- wonderful, tangible, indefatigable Dhanush, and the actor in his first Hindi film holds fort from start to finish. This is his story -- complicated but transparent, one that you may be inclined to feel judgemental about but one that you�ll see from his perspective. Eventually. What I liked:  After depicting a flair for blending a backdrop�s flavour in the Kanpur-themed narrative for Tanu Weds Manu, Rai extends his aptitude to introduce the verve of Varanasi in Raanjhanaa without making it too in-your-face. Moreover, since the film revolves around locals, doesn�t make sense to capture the visuals (by N Nataraja Subramanium, Vishal Sinha) like some wide-eyed tourist.  But the playful hues of Holi and a generally colourful palette that defines the city of temples fills the frames for most part till the story shifts to misty winters in Delhi�s Jawaharlal Nehru University campus. Narrated in flashback, Dhanush recalls the first time his Kundan�s kiddie version (a jovial Naman Jain. Also played Katrina Kaif�s fan in Bombay Talkies) laid eyes on THE object of his affection. But it Kundan�s pursuit of her (Sonam Kapoor in a chequered pinafore) as a ninth-grader (Dhanush), where he watches her imitating Madhuri Dixit�s popular Ek, do, teen/Channe ke khet mein steps or breaks into a spontaneous, ecstatic jig to Coolie�s Humka ishq hua hai yaaron after she slaps him more than one and a half dozen times to relent and reveal her name, Zoya, which packs in some ad lib humour. The second phase of their interactions has its moments too. There�s a charming scene where an amused Zoya (that�s Sonam) is standing on the balcony while our man dumb charades his way to refresh her memory. Contrasting personality isn�t some gimmick in Raanjhanaa. The idea is to depict a connection between two individuals developing with a different set of priorities. While one grows up, and in the process grows out, of the comfort zone to evolve, the other remains dedicated to a single-minded aspiration. Sonam and Dhanush have a peculiar chemistry. It�s neither simmering nor constrained but bears a quaint mystery, which deepens as they alternate to justify and contradict their actions. A nose-ringed Sonam looks like a dream even in regular attire of kurta, jeans, cardigan and stole. She does well in the light scenes but somewhat conscious when trying to seem vocal about serious, socio-political issues. Abhay Deol, though not relegated to a guest appearance, works as both -- the snag in the story and a charismatic ideal Raanjhanaa insists upon. Rai picks a solid actor for the role even if the payoff isn�t particularly satisfying. What I loved: Dhanush and A R Rahman. Music, here, is truly the food of love. Rahman�s understanding of the distress, intensity and anxiety of tender emotions often supersedes its director preoccupied with stuffing glamourised clips of active student politics. The latter could be handled with a lot more tautness and better presented arguments, which invite the same criticism as one of the members in the headstrong crowd  -- over simplification of complex issues, I get what Rai is trying to do -- craft a hard-hitting finale for his tale of a man�s passion and penance. If Rahman is Raanjhanaa�s discerning soul, Dhanush is its explosive heart and nimble body.  There�s a scene involving him, Deol and a gas cylinder. It�s subtle, funny and says volumes about his Kundan. Dhanush�s Hindi is wobbly but surprisingly grows on you even as his vigour burns the screen whether he�s clumsily asking out Sonam on his bike, joyously gate crashing a wedding procession or biting his lips in agony when affronted by the one he�s wronged. In reality as opposed to movies, people are changeable, making their mind, prone to think differently at different junctures, Raanjhanaa�s protagonists embody this impermanence and that�s what makes it unpredictable, startling.   What I disliked: For all its romantic zeal, Raanjhanaa treats its women rather roughly. Strangling someone in embrace, twisting arms to prove a point is not cute. Not romantic. Not done. Ironically, during a street play, Sonam brings up the issue of eve-teasing and how casually it�s treated in this country. It�s uncomfortable to watch the frequency at which the talented Swara Bhaskar (playing Kundan�s smitten, short-tempered childhood companion) is smacked by her male buddies (including an impressive Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub rattling off the punch-lines) as well as the abusive nature of their bonhomie. In one scene, she tries to seduce Kundan only to be rejected with a crude, �Kundan ke pyjama ka naada itna bhi kamzor nahi ke tere do hook khulne se dheela ho jaaye.� Also, alarming is the regularity with which wrists are slashed. It�s ridiculous how one rebukes another as �Jaahil/Ganwar� for making suicidal moves and two seconds later is crying hoarse about laying life if they can�t marry the one they desire. What this tells you: Raanjhanaa isn�t easy viewing. Kundan and Zoya aren�t easily likeable. They have flaws. They make mistakes. Blunders, really. But Rai shows them for what they are; he never paints a pretty picture. And this brutal honesty coupled with a commanding Dhanush is what works.</Review>

      <Review Name="Shubra Gupta" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="23rd June,2013" Likes="3" Expected="ThumbsDown">"Say you love me, or I will slit my wrists", Kundan threatens Zoya, and we know instantly that he means business. He is not saying this for a lark. Nor for a nudge-and-wink. He is saying this as if he means it. We know instantly that Raanjhanaa is a no-holds-barred love story, not your half-hearted romcom that passes for a romance these days in Bollywood. The riveting first half of the film lives up to its old- fashioned title, with a young lover whose chief driver is passion, the innocent young girl who is the object of his adoration, and the problems that keep them apart. Post interval, it comes unstuck, and squanders its gains. If Raanjhanaa had kept its tone intact, it would have been a great love story. Kundan (Dhanush), the son of a Banaras panda, is madly, deeply in love with Zoya (Kapoor). He does the running. She keeps him at bay. Just as she is about to relent, the Hindu-Muslim never-the-twain-shall-meet angle comes in, and the two part ways. I should have said 'torn asunder', actually, because that is how it is shown, him desperately chasing the train that is bearing her away, both sobbing their hearts out. When she does return, several years later, her Banarasi swain is waiting, unprepared that the girl whom he loves may love someone else (Deol). Aanand L Rai who gave us an acute, well-observed small town sensibility in his first film Tanu Weds Manu, brings the same skill sets to Raanjhanaa. It's been a while since I've seen Varanasi in the movies as a place where regular people live, not a Discovery channel shoot that peddles exotica. Rai knows the town, its people, and the lingo. Even Dhanush, whose south Indian accent is given a credible reason to exist in the film, says Banarasi launda with a flourish. The actor who really nails it, no surprise here, is Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, who plays the hero's best friend. In the second half, the film moves to Delhi, goes off to Punjab, and comes back to Delhi via Varanasi. The confusion seems to impact the characters who are left floundering. Zoya's love interest Akram is a politically active JNU lad who dreams of a better Bharat. We get a real, non-touristy Delhi and an engagement with current events ( shades of the Arvind Kejriwal-led 'people's party', the farmers' agitation in Bhatta Parsaul, the students agitation at India Gate after the December rape) that is usually missing from contemporary Bollywood. But the problem with all of this (keep an eye out for a terrific sequence which is a dig at the 'committed left-leaning JNU students' understanding of 'poverty' and 'class') is that it does not fit. The plot feels as if it is being made to function in a different film, and Raanjhanaa, by this point, is contrived and all over the place. The playfulness and intensity that Dhanush, making his Bollywood debut, exhibits consistently is what keeps the film ticking. His complete surrender to the role leads to the kind of unselfconsciousness that is so absent in Bollywood newbies who try playing lovers: if you want to show me your perfect abs, how will you let yourself screw up your face while crying for your mehbooba? And that is what makes Dhanush, who is familiar to north Indian audience only through the chartbuster Kolaveri Di, so believable. I've seen him in one Tamil film, the National-award winning Aadukalam, and there again it was visible, his becoming the part. Great casting choice, which brings back young love to Bollywood, even if it leaves me wondering: can this kind of passionate love story only be set in small towns where stalking a girl (and slitting your wrists) is still considered an acceptable plot device, as the only way of showing your feelings? Just as much Dhanush and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub feel as if they belong to the milieu, as well as Kumud Mishra (who plays Zoya's father), the others do not. Sonam Kapoor looks the part, but very often does not sound it (stumbling over such words as Bhatta Parsaul, which she has clearly pronounced for the first time, among others). She is getting better in the light-hearted bits, but her limitations as an actor are evident when she has to get serious. Swara Bhaskar, who was so good in Tanu Weds Manu, gets an over-talky but underwritten part here, and Abhay Deol sticks out, not belonging to his role at all. Raanjhanaa is a film which is all of a piece in its engaging first half, and a good Bollywood launchpad for Dhanush. Makes me want to see what he will do in his second pass.</Review>

      <Review Name="Karan Anshuman" Affiliation="Hindustan Times" Date="21st June, 2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsUp">The first thirty minutes of Raanjhanaa is absolutely riveting. Well, riveting might be the wrong word but the searing strides of a romance that covers decades in fast forward leaves you having to remember to breathe. It is impossible to tear your eyes off the screen as two factors work their magic: Dhanush's madly infectious enthusiasm as the young Kundan and the signature tune that plays every time his heart beats for the love of his life, Zoya. You want to grab on to these moments, pin them down so you can stare at them on your time with the same elation as Kundan's eyes have for Zoya. And you wonder if director AanandRai is going to tell his tale all so quickly - is this film going to end all too soon? The story is anything but a straightforward romance. If you're going in to watch it as a date film, check yourself. Raanjhanaa is expansive. It will start off charming you with the little details: the tenor of Benaras, the clarity of childhood love, the repercussions of the blinding optimism it effects and even in trifling recurring themes of falling cycles and slit wrists. As it progresses into the second half though, it will immerse you intellectually. Look for subtext - Rai goes well beyond a mere romance; he makes political statements, attacks communalism, gives us a slice of life insider account of youth wing statecraft; it's all there. It may not be entirely authentic and often exaggerated, but in Raanjhanaa's world, Rai strives to make it real. You may wonder why Rai chooses the path he does for where he takes the story in the second half, but the more you think about it, the less likely an alternate scenario you will find that he could've opted for to realize the ends Kundan and Zoya must reach. The excellent writing radiates to masterful direction. Rai's characters are all feisty. Every one of them. They move with purpose, even when they have none. What an incredible, refreshing reading and extension and twist to the Brahmin boy, Muslim girl Bollywood conundrum. And handled with such maturity and grace! He peppers his scenes with just the right amounts of humor, and hat tips cinema, people, and cultural idiosyncrasies. Kundan even pays a tribute to Ranjikanth catching an imaginary bullet between his teeth, while at another time the girl who's in love with him feeds bananas to a cow, seeking its blessing to realize a curse that will kill Zoya. If one must be entirely objective, then there are two critical moments in the film that opt for Bollywood-like contrivance. You'll know when you see them. But they don't take away from the experience. You can so easily tell Raanjhanaa falls into the pro-category of filmmaking. If only all of Bollywood's output was so polished. The camera work is delicious, restrained. Rai doesn't get into the trap of capturing everything - away with establishing shots! - he gets what is needed to tell the story in his frames and information that is relevant to the characters. Dhanush is so good, he makes you want to be him. Sonam hits her peak form. Abhay Deol, Kumud Mishra, Swara Bhaskar, and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub are scintillating as an ensemble. Raanjhanaa flows like good poetry. It is arguably the best love story of the year so far, the kind of film others in the genre should aspire.</Review>

      <Review Name="Anupama Chopra" Affiliation="Hindustan Times" Date="26th APril,2013" Likes="2" Expected="ThumbsDown">Aashiqui 2 is about two singers in love. It has the Abhimaan angle of a famous artiste, Rahul, played by Aditya Roy Kapur, discovering a small-town girl, Aarohi, played by Shraddha Kapoor, and mentoring her to glory. But director Mohit Suri and writer Shagufta Rafique update the story. The predictable jealousy angle as the partner becomes more famous is sidelined for a thornier problem - he is an alcoholic. So, in fact, Aarohi's success becomes Rahul's salvation. For a while at least, it forces him to engage with life again. It's an interesting scenario and Suri and his actors set it up well. The rockstar angle in Hindi movies always has touches of unintentional comedy - note Rahul's headgear, the stadiums filled with swooning fans and a hilariously slimy journalist in the second half who pushes Rahul to the brink again - but despite this, Aditya gives Rahul's angst a certain charm. He is earnest and broken. And the real triumph here is Shraddha, whose porcelain face has a haunting vulnerability. She's very good as the woman in the throes of a grand passion who believes that love will show the way. The problem is that once we are invested in these people, Suri doesn't take the story much further. It becomes overwrought, repetitive and, ultimately, boring. Addictions in themselves don't make for compelling cinema - after a while, Rahul consuming copious amounts of alcohol, trashing rooms and getting into brawls becomes just tedious. Suri tries hard to raise the old-school melodrama to high tragedy but the screenplay is just too clumsy and pedestrian. Like the original, Aashiqui 2 has melodious music - the song Tum hi ho, composed by Mithoon, has a lovely sweep and ache. The film, however, never becomes more than the sum of its parts. Aashiqui 2 falls into that lukewarm category of 'I didn't mind it,' which is not the same as 'I liked it.' It could have been so much more.</Review>

      <Review Name="Shubhra Gupta" Affiliation="Hindustan Times" Date="30th APril,2013" Likes="58" Expected="ThumbsDown">More than 20 years ago, the Bhatts crafted a blockbuster out of a string of songs sung by fresh voices. And a pair of new faces, artfully hidden under a jacket, for the purposes of a poster. The songs came first, the movie came after. Aashiqui's soundtrack became all the rage. So did that instantly-recognisable image of young-lovers-under-jacket. Now comes the sequel. Aashiqui number 2 has similarities with the first: the Bhatts are co-producers along with Bhushan Kumar (son of the slain T series magnate Gulshan, who was responsible for the phenomenal success of the original's music, still bouncing about in playlists). Music leads from the front again. But this time around, it is not as distinctive, and that's because the Bhatts may have become victims of their own created template of sufi-soft-pop-cum-rock. No single song of the new Aashiqui leaps out at you. And this, along with a story that starts with some lift and then dips makes the new film a messy meander. Rahul Jaykar (Aditya Roy Kapur) is a singer fighting his demons, with the help of good pal (Shaad Randhawa). Aarohi Shirke (Shraddha Kapoor) is a girl who worships Lata Mangeshkar and wants to be a singer. For reasons that are never explained, Rahul's constant companion is alcohol. Lots of it. But he is not so soused that he can't spot talent: he hears Aarohi sing in a shady Goa bar, and knows she is the next best thing. And then comes the Abhimaan-like arc, as the two deal with obscurity, fame and heartbreak, and it all becomes mothballed. Mohit Suri knows how to get lovers to start off the blocks. And the best part of this film is these two trying out each other for size, despite an embarrassing meet-cute. Roy Kapoor shows he has mettle: I was wondering about that after his turns in Action Replayy and Guzaarish, bad films both, but his potential is clear in this one. Kapoor also does a tad better than her earlier outings, but is patchy. The lead couple has a moment or two, but doesn't spark overall. The more I see these so-called love stories with promising beginnings and then wandering about, not knowing what to do with themselves, the more I wonder whether present day Bollywood has any idea of making real romances any more. Suri has directorial skill ( some of his sequences in 'Woh Lamhe' are still on recall), but where are the people writing good stuff ? Once the lovers come together, and the first act is over, why does everything slide? This Aashiqui 2 holds out promise, but doesn't make the most of it.</Review>

      <Review Name="Karan Anshuman" Affiliation="Mumbai Mirror" Date="27th April,2013" Likes="" Expected="ThumbsDown***">An alcoholic rockstar rarely in control of his actions, a culturally-rooted girl who sings at bars and aspires to be Lata. An innocent resolve to guide that snowballs into a torrid affair. Love. Addiction. Tears. Karma. Sacrifice. Music. Music, above all else. This, in a nutshell, is Aashiqui 2: freshly crated off the Bhatt assembly line. However, this time they've jilted the idea of shocking, scaring, or scarring you and opted for convention with conviction. The result: a mashup that pays tribute to Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Abhimaan and Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar. Though engaging and mature for most part, the screenplay of Aashiqui 2 stubbornly refuses to break the surface tension of the cyclic story. And, unfortunately it is neither deep nor very original, functioning more as tribute. There's hardly an emotion you haven't been manipulated into before, oldfashioned misunderstandings out of sync with the tech at hand, or a scene that doesn't feel like instant deja vu. It's reference points managed to surmount these: Abhimaan was a story Hindi film audiences hadn't seen before. And just the very scale of Rockstar coupled with Ranbir Kapoor's antics made the film cult-like. Still Aashiqui 2 does have its fair share of tender moments framed by copious amounts of tears. I liked that the relationship is purely platonic almost until the half way mark and when feelings can't be contained any more, they gush out like an unrestrained hurricane. And yet the scene that paints this picture is poignant, and gives you the one image you're likely to be left with long after you're done the movie. She hesitates, nervous about her first shot at professional singing, refusing to enter the recording studio. He tries to coax her in. They have a heart-to-heart conversation through a glass slat in the door. There's perfection even in the sound design. Love makes for an unseemly mixer for the all the alcohol he drinks. He must choose. He can't choose. Just as his weakness is the bottle, hers his him. She makes a choice. Him, with his baggage. He promises to clean up. He falters. Rinse. Repeat. Until you reach the end of the vortex. You don't move ahead much. Mostly down. The focus stays on the leads. Literally. Many one-scene characters are never seen, only the reactions of him or her. Mohit Suri has options galore for his climax. He chooses the most difficult and most correct end. It's a pity that a few weak moments of stupidity preempt in sacrifice for quality drama. That and the fact that they seem to be living on separate continents while the makers pass it off as one city. Pepper the scenes with some poor dialogue and what should've be a satisfying, sentimental date film turns out less than what you'd have hoped for. Invest, instead, in the actors. Finally, Aditya Roy Kapoor and young Shraddha Kapoor get roles with some leeway to make it their own. And Aashiqui 2 is their coming of age. Mohit Suri is a director who knows his craft and he continues to make cinema with certitude and heart. Aashiqui 2's delicate handling certainly feels more than mere execution of a script. It's just that his audience needs to be in a similar space of mind to truly enjoy this film. Sure it has its music and moments, but it doesn't really say anything new.</Review>

      <Review Name="Vinayak Chakravorty" Affiliation="India Today" Date="26th April,2013" Likes="573" Expected="ThumbsUp***">Aashiqui set quite a few trends. It ushered the new-age musical on release in 1990. The soundtrack emerged as a hero, setting a template that let producers make profits casting unknown names as leads. In turn composer duo Nadeem-Shravan emerged as superstars, dictating productions because scripts started being written to fit their songs. Their music, largely blending traditional geet and ghazal with a hint of vintage RD Burman, brought back melody after the boisterous eighties. It is essential to understand the Aashiqui phenomenon to fathom what the Bhatts were up to this time. Aashiqui 2 is in no way about setting trends. The film merely banks on the power of saleable music and the novelty of a fresh cast to enable brothers Bhatt, Mahesh and Mukesh, make maximum moolah within minimum budget as they have done all along. Mohit Suri as director should have been an advantage. Mohit has proved his mettle as a storyteller with hardhitting drama such as Zeher, Kalyug, Raaz 2 and Murder 2. In Aashiqui 2 he tries mixing that idiom with smoother strains of mush. Yet, you spot sheer lack of energy about Mohit�??s treatment this time though the overall packaging is impressively GenNow. It seems the film stretches a script worth an hour to its full runtime only because it wanted to accommodate all the songs. Aditya Roy Kapur and Shraddha Kapoor get their big breaks playing the romantic duo. Aditya is cast as Rahul Jaykar, wasted rockstar battling alcoholism. He spots the incredibly talented Aarohi Shirke (Shraddha) crooning at a bar and decides to mentor her. The narrative unfolds their blossoming romance and a couple of soothing numbers unfolds. You don�??t miss strains of Hrishikesh Mukherjee�??s 1973 hit Abhimaan (starring Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri) in the drama that follows. Aarohi�??s stardom escalates and so does Rahul�??s envy. Ego comes in the way of their love. Shagufta Rafique�??s story avoids taking risks. Bhatt flicks have always been typified by a flawed hero fighting inner angst. Aashiqui 2 lets Aditya�??s Rahul play to the gallery with that bit. If the budding actor struggles to get the nuances right, it is mainly because he gets a weak character to play out. Aditya�??s chemistry with Shraddha also suffers for the same reason. She looks pretty, as all Bollywood love stories require the heroine to, but she fails to add some spark. Finally the music, the film�??s real winner. A battery of three composers (Mithoon, Jeet Ganguly, Ankit Tiwari) give the film its big reason to cheer for. Also, lend a ear to newbie singer Arijit Singh. Here�??s hoping Aashiqui 2 does for Arijit what the first film did for Kumar Sanu all those years ago.</Review>

      <Review Name="Saibai Chatterjee" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="25th April,2013" Likes="1" = "ThumbsDown">It is a terribly trite and tested formula. The girl possesses a voice to kill for. The boy has a fan following to die for. The twosome sings for a living. The temperamental, hard-drinking male protagonist is a major composer and songwriter with many a chartbuster under his belt and a humongous chip on his shoulders. The girl � she is poor, ambitious and down to earth � struggles to make ends meet. She sings in seedy beer bars. The boy, smitten by the girl�s soulful singing of a song that he made a name with, goes out of his way to help her find a firmer foothold in the business and get ahead in life. And when there is so much music wafting in the air, can Cupid's arrow be far behind? It finds its mark soon enough and the duo is soon exchanging sweet nothings. But before the boy, Rahul Jaykar (Aditya Roy Kapoor), knows it, he has been upstaged by the girl, Aarohi Shirke (Shraddha Kapoor). Her stocks zoom; he hits the skids. The more she sings the deeper he sinks. Yes, you�ve guessed it, tension and heartburn erupt between the two. And the drama takes on a shrill edge. Aashiqui 2, directed by Mohit Suri, isn�t a retelling of merely the 1990 hit with which Mahesh Bhatt made instant but transitory stars out of Rahul Roy and Anu Agarwal. This story has been on the silver screen times without number ever since David O Selznick produced A Star is Born three quarters of a century ago. In Mumbai, most memorably, it took the form of Hrishikesh Mukherjee�s Amitabh Bachchan-Jaya Bhaduri 1973 starrer Abhimaan. Does Aashiqui 2 have anything new to offer? Nothing at all. It is a musical love story with a feel so old-world that it reeks of staleness. There is little in the latest incarnation of A Star is Born that could be held up by its producers as a pressing enough explanation for why this musical love story, which one thought was a deal that had been done and dusted for good, had to be made all over again. Even the lead actors aren't newcomers, so do not expect them to inject any freshness into the proceedings. Aashiqui 2 is actually an attempt to relaunch the careers of Aditya Roy Kapoor (London Dreams, Action Replayy, Guzaarish) and Shraddha Kapoor (Luv Ka The End, Teen Patti). It does not seem likely yield the desired result. The lead pair is at best passable. Neither of the two is a finished article yet. They give their roles their all, but the impact of their labour falls way short of the intended target. If that isn't bad enough, the film is also weighed down by clich�-ridden screenplay. It leaves too much to Aditya and Shraddha and neither has the wherewithal yet to be able to cover up for what the script lacks. Aashiqui 2 is riddled with syrupy inanities that add up to insubstantial treacle. No amount of surface gloss can salvage it. The film is obviously meant for a youth audience, which is probably not the easiest segment to inveigle. Aditya Roy Kapoor, in his first full-fledged lead role, exudes the kind of confidence that borders on airiness. He is fine in the lighter moments, but when the drama turns intense, the chinks begin to show. There are situations in the plot that simply aren�t convincing enough, and the young actor can do little to extract something of significance out of them. Shraddha Kapoor, too, shows promise, but only in flashes. On the evidence available in Aashiqui, she has the makings of a star with some staying power provided she learns to stay within her limitations. A musical love story works best when both the songs and the romance border on the inspired. 1990�s Aashiqui, despite its box office success, wasn�t such a great film. What has ensured immortality for it was its music album, which still ranks among the most popular ever produced in Mumbai. In Aashiqui 2, some of the songs are definitely hummable, but the musical score as a whole is patchy. And the love story in which they are embedded lacks the requisite solidity. So neither film nor the music ever rises above the very, very ordinary. Fluffy and flaky, Aashiqui 2 is simply not peppy enough to paper over its cracks.</Review>

      <Review Name="Rajeev Masand" Affiliation="CNN IBN" Date="27th July,2013" Likes="">Although the last photograph of him in public records dates back to over 20 years ago, Dawood Ibrahim remains an endlessly fascinating character, particularly for our filmmakers who never seem to run out of script ideas involving India's most wanted terrorist. Nikhil Advani's 'D-Day' is the latest, a promising action thriller constructed around the long-cherished dream of capturing Dawood, the principal accused in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case. The role of Dawood himself, referred to in this film as Iqbal Seth, and nicknamed Goldman, is played creepily by Rishi Kapoor sporting a moustache and rose-tinted shades. We first see him in the film's terrific opening sequence, arriving for a wedding celebration at a Karachi hotel, where, despite heavy security, an audacious plan to nab him is underway. The film's crisp first-half, much of it unfolding in flashback, sets up the drama nicely. The chief of India's Research &amp; Analysis Wing (or R&amp;AW) has put Operation Goldman into motion, following another blast in India masterminded by the terror monger who is staked out in Pakistan. A covert team of undercover agents Wali (Irrfan Khan), Rudra (Arjun Rampal), Zoya (Huma Qureshi), and Aslam (Akash Dahiya) have been tasked with ferreting out Iqbal as he gets ready to attend his son's wedding. Meshing fact with fiction, often sacrificing logic for thrills, the briskly paced script (co-written by Ritesh Shah, Suresh Nair, and Advani) slows down routinely to show us the agents in their downtime with family and lovers, even as they flesh out their grand plan collectively. Rudra takes up with a melancholic prostitute (Shruti Haasan) in a red-light district, while Wali is deeply committed to his young son and wife (played with aching vulnerability by Sreeswara). 'D-Day', with all its gritty action, hand-held camerawork and frenetic editing, is still closer in spirit and tone to 'Ek Tha Tiger' and 'Agent Vinod' than 'Zero Dark Thirty'. The film can't escape typical jingoistic traps, and doesn't think twice of forsaking realism for filmi heroism. So our undercover heroes get into a public scrap with an ISI agent in broad daylight, and in one spectacularly silly scene, Rudra follows a man who had disfigured his lover's face and stabs him brutally to death in a garage, evidently unconcerned about raising suspicions. But if you're willing to sidestep niggling problems like the rapidly rising body count they leave in their wake, and the apparent ease with which our heroes secure ammo in Pakistan, you'll note the film's second half raises some interesting points, including the very real conundrum of secret agents who're abandoned by their governments in hostile lands after failed operations. There's also one remarkably filmed song in which Advani takes one of our protagonists through a bloody massacre of a loved one, as if it were happening before his very eyes. It's portions like these that elevate the film from the ordinary, and much credit must also go to its committed cast. No praise is enough for the chameleon-like Rishi Kapoor, who adapts himself to the film's two very different tones, and offers a performance that is menacing and hammy in all the right places. The talented Huma Qureshi is under-utilised here, but plays her part competently. A quick mention also of Chandan Roy Sanyal who is deliciously sadistic as Iqbal's nephew and right-hand man. But the film is a showcase for its two male leads. Irrfan Khan excellently conveys the quiet desperation of a man torn between family and mission, and Arjun Rampal does some of his best work here as the rebellious agent simmering with pent up anger. 'D-Day' is far from perfect, but as pulpy Bollywood action films go, it's very watchable and works its strengths. The film's ending, controversial and melodramatic to say the least, nevertheless sits comfortably with the wish-fulfilment fantasy that Advani's milking. I'm going with three out of five. It's worth a watch; you won't be bored.</Review>

      <Review Name="Vinayak Chakravorty" Affiliation="India Today" Date="19th July,2013" Likes="">D-Day stars Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan with a cluster of actors who have off and on proved their mettle. For director Nikhil Advani, that was half the battle won. Advani, who has desperately tried exorcising the demons of Salaam-e-Ishq and Chandni Chowk To China for a while now, discards masala basics to go for the high octane with his latest. The film tries balancing gritty realism with what sells. Also, the fact that D-Day has no big stars has been cloaked with sufficient melodrama and some good action. The overall package works for a one-time watch. D-Day could have been much more if Advani was more assured as a storyteller. Despite a plum cast, the narrative tends to become convoluted at times. A highlight in the promos has been Rishi Kapoor's latest villain avatar. He plays Karachi-based don/businessman Iqbal, alias Goldman, but his thick moustache, trademark shades and wig betray a Bollywoodised Dawood Ibrahim. The veteran has been on a killer spree of evil lately, triggered off by Agneepath and carried forward with aplomb in Aurangzeb. D-Day completes a nice set of three in villainy for the actor. But if Goldman isn't a patch on Agneepath's ruthless pimp Rauf Lala, Rishi Kapoor can't be blamed. We have seen too many of these Dawood-type rehashes now in Bollywood for the prototype to remain novel. The actor however scores by delivering the sinister with an understated edge and flamboyance. Irrfan is cast as Wali Khan, RAW agent in Karachi to trace Goldman's movement. The don lives in a high-security set-up monitored by ISI. Wali finds a possible chink in the armour when he learns Goldman will break ISI security protocol to come out for his son's wedding. A team is put in place. Armyman Rudra Pratap Singh (Arjun Rampal), RAW explosives expert Zoya Rehman (Huma Qureshi) and Aslam (Akash Dhaiya), a petty thief employed by RAW, have to bring back the terrorist to India. To max out the drama, each has a personal score to settle beyond the line of duty. Of course, there is a twist. It takes the film to a credible climax. But you realise that in parts the film's tendency to be violent could merely be a ploy to extend runtime. A talented cast comes up with functional performances. Irrfan, Arjun and Huma get some cool action that they clearly enjoy essaying. Shruti Haasan, introduced in the script as a Pakistani sex worker, does well to balance titillation with a tragic subplot. And watching Rishi Kapoor hit the menace mode, you only wish the eighties chocolate boy takes to shades of grey more often. D-Day is quick and sleek. It is your film if violence mixed with melodrama and pop patriotism is your cocktail of choice.</Review>

      <Review Name="Mansha Rastogi" Affiliation="nowrunning.com" Date="19th July,2013" Likes="1">The setting is that of a wedding, Rajpal Yadav crooning to Mast Kalandar in his booming voice. The backdrop is established for the world's most wanted man Iqbal (Rishi Kapoor) who will be present there for it's his son's wedding. There's ample commotion with a surge of people out to capture the gangster. Cut to parking lot of the hotel where the wedding is happening, Rudra (Arjun Rampal) has Iqbal at gun point but Wali Khan (Irrfan Khan) doesn't want him to shoot. What follows is a loud gun-shot, a bomb blast and a black out. Is Iqbal shot? Who are those four people? Watch the film to find out. Known for exaggerated melodramatic family sagas or romantic fairs like Kal Ho Na Ho or Salaam-E-Ishq, filmmaker Nikhil Advani marks a major shift in his filmmaking as he makes this taut espionage thriller D-Day. The film is about four RAW Agents Rudra, Wali, Aslam (Aakash Dahiya) and Zoya (Huma Qureshi) who are set out on a mission by RAW director Ashwini Rao (Nasser) to capture the most wanted man and bring him back to India. But each of them have their own personal baggage to tackle with as well, while Wali gets a wife and a kid whom he adores during his undercover stint in Pakistan, Zoya leaves behind her fiance for this mission. Nikhil Advani attempts a tight and gripping story about undercover agents pretty much like Hollywood's Zero Dark Thirty. However, it's the stress on the emotional angle of every character that gets in the way making the film appear prolonged. But that doesn't take away the fact that he still gets a startling drama which will make you sit at the edge of your seat for most parts. It's the story-telling technique of Nikhil in the first half that deserves to be applauded. He proceeds to the crime scene within the initial 15 minutes and rewinds the incident giving it an edgy and pacey build up. His strength also lies in his casting. Right from having Rishi Kapoor for a fashionably loud, and volatile Iqbal Seth who breathes life into his character to Irrfan Khan who can literally sleep walk into any character under the sun, every character is impactful. Arjun Rampal has excelled himself by leaps and bound and makes a commendable effort of an ex-army man turned RAW Agent delightfully. South actor Nasser fits the bill perfectly and brings the much needed weight to his character. Chandan Roy Sanyal as Iqbal's bhanja (nephew) is extremely impressive. There are certain scenes in the film which are exceptionally shot and demand a round of applause. Especially the song sequence over the crime scene of Shruti Haasan who plays a prostitute from Pakistan sheltering Rudra. The cinematography work throughout the film is brilliant as it convincingly establishes the coarse background of Karachi, the gangster stables etc. Had it not been for a jingoistic speech towards the end and the highly melodramatic familial sagas of each and every character along with predictable turn of events, D-Day could have been a flawless nail-biting thriller which it was throughout the first half. But despite its flaws, the movie still deserves a watch.</Review>

Irrfan amazes, switching from tender to treacherous in a flash, authentic as he calls out "Rudar!" to Rudra Pratap Singh (Arjun), a man of molten mysteries, introduced with a Lawrence of Arabia-like flair. Arjun looks smashing and pulls off a competent act while Zoya (Huma) does well as a cutie-pie who can squeeze a knife real bad. Aslam (Aakash Dahiya), a gangster-turned-agent, forms the fourth wheel, but Rishi Kapoor stands out as Iqbal Seth, with his polyester-like silky malevolence, his mocking manipulations, his eyes behind red goggles, both frightened and frightening. That mirrors the plot which flips rapidly, hunters becoming the hunted, then vice-versa. Nasser, as RAW director Ashwini Rao, is convincing as an official straining at the leash while Iqbal's bhanja (Chandan Sanyal) is splendid with his simply asinine evil. A beautifully fragile Shruti Haasan plays a prostitute sheltering Rudra. Their track is short but sensual, a little lily-pool of beauty in an otherwise relentlessly harsh cinematography, where Karachi's grey, gritty and gunpowder-laced. But this being Bollywood, the plot can't escape emotional excursions. Some - Rudra's love-life, Zoya's break-up - adds a halwa-like heaviness to this Karachi. But the second half refreshes your palate, sizzling sequences between Wali, Rudra and Iqbal Seth leaving you open-mouthed, the 'c' in this climax clearly for controversy. Catch it - this 'D' company denotes both debate and desh-prem.</Review>

      <Review Name="Taran Adarsh" Affiliation="" Date="18th July,2013" Likes="">The Hindi film industry is indeed going through an exhilarating phase. A variety of movies and assorted stories are being attempted week after week. With a novel tale unfolding every week, a Hindi movie buff has a lot to look forward to. Who would've ever anticipated that the maker of poignant and stirring films like KAL HO NAA HO, SALAAM-E-ISHQ and PATIALA HOUSE -- underlining a strong emotional undercurrent in each of those films -- would attempt a film about India's Most Wanted Man? Not me, for sure! But Nikhil Advani ventures into an alien terrain with D-DAY, which, on surface, may seem like yet another gangster film, but it's not. There have been a lot of debates about gangsters who have sought a secure haven on foreign soil and a lot is being said about getting them back to India for trial and justice. But D-DAY is the first Hindi film to explore this pertinent aspect [read burning issue]. The plotline of D-DAY conjures up memories of the 2012 film ZERO DARK THIRTY, which was about the manhunt for the world's most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden. However, the similarities between the two films end there. What makes D-DAY relevant and relatable is the fact that Nikhil borrows from real-life headlines/occurrences and gives it a new spin altogether, interpreting the story his way. The basic premise of the film -- RAW agents being assigned the task of bringing back the fugitive crime lord back to India -- evokes tremendous curiosity, but at the same time, Nikhil knows that since the subject matter is sensitive and volatile, it ought to be tackled with extreme concern and caution. Thankfully, Nikhil treats this explosive theme with extreme care. Nine years ago, Wali Khan [Irrfan] was sent to Karachi, Pakistan by the Chief of RAW Ashwini Rao [Nasser] to report the activities of the Most Wanted Man in India. Nine days ago, Rudra Pratap Singh [Arjun Rampal], Indian Armed Forces, Zoya Rehman [Huma Qureshi], RAW Explosives Expert and Aslam [Aakash Daahiya], a petty thief from the streets of Mumbai, recruited by RAW, join Wali in Pakistan to carry out the mission to bring back the Most Wanted Man in India. The man who was going to break all ISI protocol and security and attend his own son's wedding. The man who could, on that day, be abducted and brought back to India to face justice. The team sent in to bring the Most Wanted Man in India did the unthinkable -- they carried out the most daring operation and almost got away with it. Almost, because something went horribly wrong! There have been umpteen debates and discussions to extradite gangsters and criminals operating from foreign land and Nikhil, together with writers Ritesh Shah and Suresh Nair, weaves a yarn that's part bona fide, part fiction. D-DAY is gritty and hard-hitting, but most importantly, it's an earnest attempt. The setting appears authentic [D-DAY gives the impression of being filmed in Pakistan], the sequence of events is well connected and the implementation of the written material is compelling. Not once do you feel that Nikhil bites off more than he can chew. D-DAY tackles a knotty issue and it's imperative that Nikhil stays close to authenticity. The demanding plot and the edgy, gritty and raw situations, besides the ambience [recreating Karachi], makes this espionage thriller so different from the gangster films we have witnessed on the Hindi screen thus far. The four patriots, each with a back story, joining hands for a common mission, their expedition and how the hunters become the hunted in the neighbouring country gives the film that edge and power that's hard to expunge from memory. Nikhil reserves the best for the finale. The fight at the border and what ensues blows your mind and can easily be termed as the icing on the cake. Sure, Nikhil and his writers run their imagination wild here, but let me tell you, this finale is sure to meet with wild cheers. The sole hiccup is that the film appears elongated and could've been short and snappy by 10/15 odd minutes. A succinctly narrated theme only aids in augmenting the overall impact, as we know by now. Nikhil keeps the action [Tom Struthers] as real as possible. Besides, the action in D-DAY is not the type that is dominating the Hindi screen of late. It's raw, but believable, keeping in mind the characters the protagonists illustrate. The soundtrack [Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy] is absolutely in sync with the mood of the film. The best track of the film is, without doubt, 'Alvida'. The visuals in the song are mind-blowing. Tushar Kanti Ray's cinematography captures the gritty ambience to perfection. Dialogue [Ritesh Shah and Niranjan Iyengar] are strong and compelling. D-DAY has an ensemble cast, but the scene stealer is, without doubt, Rishi Kapoor. The veteran continues to push boundaries, challenging himself and astonishing the spectators. Recall the man coping with inflation in DO DOONI CHAAR, the stern family patriarch in PATIALA HOUSE, the villainous character in AGNEEPATH, the college dean in STUDENT OF THE YEAR and the ageing romantic in CHASHME BADDOOR. D-DAY proves his versatility yet again as he gets to portray the much-feared don. He's tremendous! Irrfan has always proved himself, irrespective of how good/bad the film may be, and it's no different this time. Of course, the accomplished actor gets a power-packed character and he leaves a stunning impact yet again. The film proves, yet again, his brilliance as an artiste of calibre in several sequences, especially the ones towards the closing stages of the film. Arjun Rampal continues to surprise and evolve as an actor. It seems, he is on an experimenting mood and the character he portrays in D-DAY gives him the opportunity to step forward as an actor. He's top notch! Huma Qureshi too gets ample opportunity to get into a diverse zone with this film and she seizes the prospect instantaneously. She stands on her own, despite the presence of formidable and much-experienced actors in the frame. Shruti Haasan gets a complicated, layered character and she handles it with gusto. The chemistry with Arjun is electrifying as well. Sriswara, portraying the character of Irrfan's wife, is a revelation. She will make heads turn with her talent. Aakash Daahiya is competent. Although the film stars far more experienced names, he grabs you attention every time he appears on screen. Nasser [as RAW chief], K.K. Raina [as Gen. Raza], Chandan Roy Sanyal [as Bhanja], Imran Hasnee [as Saleem Pathan], Nissar Khan [as Niyaaz Ahmed] and Sandeep Kulkarni [as Atul Mishra] -- each of them contribute so much to every sequence. Divij Handa, as Irrfan's kid Kabir, is super. Rajpal Yadav's presence enlivens the song at the very start. On the whole, D-DAY is what a well-made thriller ought to be -- taut, transfixing and spellbinding, with an astounding finale. Don't miss this high-octane thriller!</Review>

      <Review Name="Mayank Shekhar" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="24th Dec,2009" Likes="0">By now, I guess the word of mouth is already out. It shouldn't be news to anyone that 3 Idiots surely deserves three cheers, and more. But the first thing you realise about this film is not that a 44-year-old Aamir Khan can play a 22-year-old college kid, and he can get away with it. Well, he does. What you realise actually, as director Raju Hirani does, is that to make a very urgent point, one doesn't need to preach and get all self-serious. A lot can be said purely through songs and suspensions of disbelief. And a wonderful genre called comedy. The film is actually a fairly serious take on a cruel examination system that gets passed off for an education system in this country. We produce IIT graduates who take up high-paying jobs. We don't make original thinkers who could pick up a Nobel prize for an invention. Aamir's Rancho is actually one such natural genius. He obviously can't fit into an Indian classroom, where all you have to do is mug up, to rise up. He plays the fool. But he still tops the tests. His two friends remain flunkeys throughout. And that is because, one of them, is burdened by his family's expectations and a fear of exams. The other is passionate about wildlife photography, and not physics. In India, even now, you should either be in engineering or medicine. It's usually the parents' promissory note. It's also a suicide note for many. The hilarious skits between the three friends and their dull, dreaded professor here, Virus, played by Boman Irani, reveal a non-stop Munnabhai comedy with a similar purpose. Rancho takes on Virus and the system. Virus takes on Rancho, and his friends. And one day, Rancho completely disappears. Many years later, his friends go out in search of who he was. As Raju Hirani says, this film is about five per cent of Chetan Bhagat's bestseller Five Point Someone. This is in fact a hardcore Bollywood flick, which demands its own share of subjectivity while you watch many parts of the story fit very conveniently into the larger scheme. The filmmakers know just when to throw in that emotional low, after a comical high. They know when the song is most appropriate. And when melodrama will do just fine. Very few contemporary Bollywood directors understand this now. The fact that you don't feel like the fourth idiot watching 3 Idiots is, for its genre, the greatest relief. This is in every way Munnabhai - part 3. I think you shouldn't miss it at all.</Review>

      <Review Name="Rajeev Masand" Affiliation="CNN IBN" Date="28th Dec,2009" Likes="">Going home after watching 3 Idiots I felt like I'd just been to my favorite restaurant only to be a tad under-whelmed by their signature dish. It was a satisfying meal, don't get me wrong, but not the best meal I'd been expecting. 3 Idiots, starring Aamir Khan, produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, and written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, is a film of impeccable pedigree. It's a breezy entertainer and it's got its heart in the right place, but it appears to be lacking in the naiive idealism and old-fashioned sincerity that propelled Hirani's two Munnabhai films to cult status. Loosely based on Chetan Bhagat's pulpy bestseller Five Point Someone, 3 Idiots takes light-hearted but pointed jabs at the Indian education system, raising pertinent questions about the relevance of learning by rote, the obsession with high grades, and the dangerous repercussions of parental pressure to pursue traditional streams. Set on an engineering campus in Delhi modeled after the IIT, the film features Aamir Khan as free-spirited student Rancho who dishes out important life lessons to his roommates Farhan and Raju (played by R Madhavan and Sharman Joshi), even as Naziesque campus director Viru Sahastrabuddhe (played by Boman Irani) clashes with him for brazenly rejecting conventional wisdom. Rancho, as it turns out, can do just about anything. From empowering Farhan to convince his family he wants to be a photographer not an engineer, to nursing another friend back to health after a failed suicide attempt, Rancho even helps an unsuspecting girl open her eyes to the superficial jerk she's about to marry, and believe it or not, at one point he even delivers a baby on the college ping-pong table following instructions from a doctor on webcam. But soon after teaching them these valuable lessons and touching their lives in some way or the other, Rancho vanishes. The film is told mostly in flashback, with Farhan and Raju setting off to find their buddy a few years later. And because no Hindi film can be complete without a romance, Hirani and his co-writer Abhijat Joshi also manage to squeeze in a love track between Rancho and the college director's daughter Pia (played by Kareena Kapoor). The film's first half breezes by effortlessly between Hirani's trademark comic flourishes including a hilarious ragging scene, two witty confrontations with teachers, and even an uproarious Farrelly Brothers-style gag involving a rolling pin and a paralysed man. Expectedly, the humor is alternated with moments of poignancy like that delicate scene in which the group first discovers a fellow student's suicide. Problem is, the genuine lump-in-your-throat moments are few and far between, the screenplay populated instead by a batch of scenes calling for push-button emotions. Where the Munnabhai films cunningly tricked you into shedding an unexpected tear, 3 Idiots goes for full-throttle melodrama. The film's second half in particular, is a tiring mess of ridiculous back-stories, convenient coincidences and sappy sentimentality. Despite these hiccups, the film still works to a fair extent because of the inherent optimism in the plot and the sheer good-naturedness of its characters. It's hard to resist Rancho's cheery "All izz well" chant even if Hirani does push it a little too far when he ties it to a baby's first in-womb kick, and the scene I mentioned earlier involving a delivery on a ping-pong table. Of the cast, Sharman Joshi has a meatier role than R Madhavan, hence succeeds in fleshing him out more competently. Kareena Kapoor makes her presence felt despite the small role, and Boman Irani - although he's trapped in a caricature - inspires hearty laughs. But for me, the performance that stood out in this film belongs to lesser-known LA-based actor Omi Vaidya who stars as the Hindi-challenged Chatur Ramalingam, who deserves credit for turning an old childish gag into what is one of the film's funniest scenes on the strength of his pitch-perfect expressions and delivery. And then of course, there's Aamir Khan as Rancho. Who never quite passes off as a 20-something-year-old, but remains the heart and soul of 3 Idiots with his spot-on comedy, his measured histrionics, and his immense likeability. The film, in the end, is a broad entertainer that plays to the gallery, well-intentioned but sadly muddled. However it's warmer than any other comedy this year - think Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, All The Best or De Dana Dan - and hence it's unquestionably an enjoyable watch. From the man behind those decade-defining Munnabhai films, however, it is far from his best work. I'm going with three out of five for director Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, an earnest but calculated effort that runs, but never flies. Watch it anyway, because it's the season to be jolly, and good laughs are guaranteed.</Review>

    <Reviews>
      <Review Name="Aniruddha Guha" Affiliation="DNA" Date="24th Dec,2013" Likes="">Rajkumar Hirani is the best filmmaker Hindi cinema has produced in a long, long time. It's not that there aren't other mavericks, geniuses, and talented storytellers who give us some fabulous movies from time to time. But Hirani has, one film after the other, proved his mettle as a writer/director who does not believe in giving you entertainment the easy way ? he ensures that you take back home a few lessons about life, too. Three Idiots has one of the most relevant issues of Indian society at its core, a heartwarming story woven around it and a narrative that takes you through the film effortlessly, leaving you happy, moved, and thoughtful in the end. Yes, the film has certain hard-to-digest moments ? like engineering students helping a woman to deliver a child in the campus with the help of some 'skills' ? but if the oft misused term 'cinematic liberty' has ever been put to apt use, it is here. Ranchhoddas Chhanchad aka Rancho (Khan), Farhan Qureshi (Madhavan), and Raju Rastogi (Joshi) have got admission in ICE, the most prestigious engineering college in India. "You'll have to beat your competitor every step of the way if you want to be successful in life," dean Viru Sahastrabudhhe aka Virus (Irani) tells students on their first day in college. While the others just follow orders, Rancho defies rules. He raises questions in class his teachers can't answer, refuses to complete assignments unless he really enjoys them, and infuriates the dean, who is a stickler for perfection. "You have the best college in the country, yet none of your students has ever invented anything of note," Rancho tells the dean straight-faced, enraging him further. To make matters worse, he falls in love with the dean's daughter (Kapoor). The dean is out to make Rancho's life hell but is baffled how Rancho deceives him every time. The most laidback of all students, he surprises everyone by ending at the top of the class, year after year, confounding even his two friends. "We learnt an important lesson," says Farhan. "When your friend fails an examination, you feel bad. But when he tops it, you feel worse." Rancho explains to his friends that the only reason he excels at everything he does is because he enjoys doing them. He coerces the two to follow their goals without worrying about the end result, and by the end of the four-year period, the two feel more confident of what they want to do in life than before they entered college and met Rancho. While the institute asked them to chase success, Rancho asked them to chase excellence, assuring them that success would follow. But soon after teaching them life's most valuable lesson, Rancho disappears. Why does Rancho leave without telling anyone of his whereabouts? Where does he go? The film starts with Farhan and Raju renewing their search for Rancho after five years, following a lead they get on his whereabouts from one of their closest competitors in college, Chatur. The movie then moves into flashback mode, returning to real time every now and then. Starting with the first scene, the screenplay moves in one fluid motion, interweaving scenes and sequences one after the other in brilliant, seamless fashion. Writers Hirani and Abhijat Joshi (story, screenplay, and dialogues) and Vidhu Vinod Chopra (screenplay associate) have worked painstakingly on every sequence, each of which stands out for its brilliance. There are so many 'highlights' and scenes that impress you that pointing out a few would be unfair to the others. Three Idiots is, in every way, a complete film ? one that works in its entirety, be it storytelling, dialogues, acting, music, cinematography, art direction, editing, etc. At the helm of it all is the captain of the ship ? director Rajkumar Hirani. Madhavan puts in a restrained performance and brings both the maturity and confusion that his character requires. Joshi is good. His character undergoes immense change in the film and the actor brings across those subtle differences beautifully. Kapoor, in a smaller role, does a good job. Irani's performance ranges from competent to caricaturish, but works with the mood of the film. Omi as Chatur aka Silencer gets ample screen space and performs well as the grades-hungry student everyone hates in class. Shantanu Moitra's music blends into the film perfectly and the songs are extremely hummable. Hirani is impeccable with his editing and CK Muraleedharan's cinematography is easy on the eyes. Aamir Khan and Rajikumar Hirani coming together was always going to be special. Three Idiots sure is. In fact, the film blends elements of Khan's Taare Zameen Par with Hirani's Munnabhai series, making a comment on the education system without going down the documentary route, but the film stands out on its own. Even as you have come to accept Khan's genius at ensuring a good product for audiences every time, this one is a Rajkumar Hirani show all the way. And it becomes easy to say that because even if you take Khan out of the equation, the film would probably make a similar impact. That is not to say having Khan doesn't help. The character of Rancho is the voice of the film, innocent yet intelligent, and the script demanded an actor of Khan's calibre to take across the film's message to audiences. As a younger man, Khan springs the kind of performance you associate him with. For the three hours that you are watching the film, Khan ceases to exist and Rancho takes over. But the real hero of Three Idiots is the guy who gave us jaadu ki jhappi and Gandhigiri. Raju Hirani, you are the man! After all the terrible films and flops this year, you have ensured that in the end, Aall Izz Well.</Review>

      <Review Name="Nikhat Kazmi" Affiliation="Times of India" Date="24th Dec,2013" Likes="">Rest assured, all ye desi cinema buffs, Aal Izz Well in apna Bollywood. If 2009 can begin with Dev D and end with 3 Idiots, it is indeed time to sound the seetis and taalis for one of the most exciting years of contemporary Indian cinema. Truly, this has been the year of the I.d.i.o.t in movielore: the Intrinsically intelligent, Downright smart, Inimitable, Original and Talented film maker, actor, story teller, musician, lyricist, dialogue writer and producer. 3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less travelled by. The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference. So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills. The high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humour and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic `humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track. Amongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows. Both Sharman and Madhavan manage to carve their independent characters as lovable rebels too. Even Kareena shines out, despite the minuscule length of her role. A special mention for Boman Irani who is impeccable as `Virus', the vile Principal and newcomer Omi who perfectly slips into the stereotype of the best, albeit bakwas student. Shantanu Moitra's music score, which may have sounded pheeka in the audio version, comes alive on screen with lyricist Swanand Kirkire giving India its clarion call for 2010: Aal Izz Well. Rush for it.</Review>

      <Review Name="Shubhra Gupta" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="20th July,2013" Likes="3">Early on in the film, one character tells another: "Kya ghisi-piti baatein kar rahe ho, kuch naya kaho na (Why are you saying the same old things, say something new)." It should have been the tagline of Ramaiya Vastavaiya, the most shopworn, tired film I have seen in a while. It is a remake of a Prabhu Deva's own Telugu hit which was a remake of Maine Pyar Kiya, which itself was a refurbished version of the romances Hindi cinema was churning out in the '60s. Instead of Salman Khan and Bhagyashree, we have Girish Kumar and Shruti Haasan. Around a quarter of a century separates the two films. Why and for whom is this film being made? It is a Tips production and the lead actor is a Taurani (the producer's) scion, so it is understandable that you would want a cast-iron hit. So of course, you would reach for the oldest plot in the world: a poor- but- proud heroine, a rich- but ultimately- nice hero, an over-protective brother of the girl, and mealy-mouthed parents of the boy. The first half is spent in a large 'shaadi�wala' ghar with village belle Sona (Haasan) and the Australia-returned Ram (Kumar) making faces at each other, and then falling into each other's arms. Cue arrival of poor-but-proud bada bhaiya (Sood), so that the nasty elders (Nasser, Shah, Dhillon) can humiliate him and tell him to get out. Second half: city boy Ram shows up in the village, picks up cow dung, milks said cows, sleeps on straw pallets and eats terrible food, all to win over the bhaiya, and take his dulhan away. Each minute hangs like lead. Every single clich� in the book is thrown into the mix, with poor Poonam Dhillon as the boy's mother-from-hell, and Randhir Kapoor as the father-of- the-boy- trying hard to act sensible, having to mouth the most inane lines. I had not an iota of interest in the leads, neither in the first-timer Kumar, nor in Haasan who appears a veteran in comparison. My heart goes out to Sonu Sood who is a good actor, and who gets stuck in this kind of tripe. And why, in a Prabhu Deva film, was there not a single dance that made me want to get up and jive? He does show up in one number, but it is old and tired as his film.</Review>

      <Review Name="Vinayak Chakravorty" Affiliation="India Today" Date="29th July, 2013" Likes="4">The Bollywood rehash factory won't slow down. Love stories especially find a way of returning every few years, in a new package with new faces and with very much the same plot. Any resemblance Ramaiya Vastavaiya bears with Maine Pyar Kiya and Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya was perhaps absolutely intended. These were blockbusters, as was the Telugu film Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana - Prabhudheva's 2005 directorial debut that inspires this film (and which in turn was a copy of Maine Pyar Kiya). If producer Kumar Taurani wanted tested formula to launch son Girish Kumar, he has played it safe. The script credited to Shiraz Ahmed casts Girish as Ram, cool dude who falls for a rustic girl (Shruti Haasan). He chases her all the way to her hometown. Enter her big brother (Sonu Sood), who throws a challenge. Ram will get his girl if he produces more harvest in their field than Bade Bhaiya generally does. Prabhudheva's new film has a dated feel about it, given its story and the stereotypes it banks on. He tries making up for as much with the stock picture of frolic between the young leads besides ample melodrama. The film is funny in parts, the songs work to an extent and an overdose of mush pervades. Girish seems to lack the screen presence of a solo hero in a mainstream project. Shruti looks pretty all through but that was obviously never enough to salvage this cliched fare. Sonu Sood plays to the gallery with abundant hyper bursts. Ramaiya Vastavaiya offers nothing new. Ironic for a film meant to launch a new face.</Review>

      <Review Name="Tushar joshi" Affiliation="DNA" Date="18th July, 2013" Likes="">An ode to over-the-top love stories of the 90s where a village setting becomes the backdrop for a casteist boy-girl romance whose end is known but the journey to that point is laden with heavy duty dialogues, emotional upheaval and the mandatory supporting characters � a buffoon , a zamindar, and a goddess temple perched atop a hill. Prabhu Deva mixes these yesteryear ingredients to dish out a formulaic film with melodious tunes and some enjoyable light moments. Ram (Girish) and Sona (Shruti) play lovers separated by the overused  ameer-gareeb boundary. He�s the rich spoilt brat from Australia while she�s a village belle whose clay horse toy and her brother (Sonu) mean the world to her! The first half has some fun and frothy situational moments, while post interval Prabhu ups the ante with Ram having to prove his love by meeting the challenge of harvesting double the crop farmed by her brother. This linear story deviates several times with  some of the most loud characters and silly slapstick jokes of recent times. What�s hot Girish Kumar�s introductory surf board scene is an antithesis of his on-screen character. Strangely that works in his favour. He has a childlike effervescence which might seem a bit odd and annoying in the beginning, but with time that becomes the reason for his likeability. He has a promising future, but we don�t know if this was the right debut vehicle. Shruti has an easy going charm about herself in her interactions with Girish. Even though they don�t have remarkable chemistry, you can sense her putting in that extra effort to hard sell their jodi. Music is above average, with the Jeena Laga Hoon track already topping charts. Sonu Sood and Vinod Khanna look their part, especially the former who doesn�t seem out of place in a rustic setting. Prabhu Deva�s guest appearance with Jacqueline in her item song adds the right zing post interval. What�s not There is a sense of disconnect between the first and second half.  Some scenes are stretched beyond requirement (bathtub and the dog encounter, long introduction to Sonu�s character, MMS leak moment at the wedding). The storyline is very reminiscent of the 1998 Salman-Kajol starrer Pyaar Kiya Toh Darna Kya. Humour takes a severe beating with funny scenes between Girish and Paresh Ganatra looking like amateur episodes from a failed standup comedy show (a character pees on Zakir Hussain�s face!). Also the climax with the thunder claps and throwback background sound effects falls flat. There isn�t enough classic courting or romantic scenes between the leads. For a greater duration they are reduced to playing the clich�d �love me-hate me� cat and mouse game. To watch or not to If old school, loud and over-dramatic romance is your thing, then Ramaiya Vastavaiya is the ticket to buy!</Review>

      <Review Name="Mansha Rastogi" Affiliation="nowrunning.com" Date="19th July, 2013" Likes="1">Considering the kind of films Prabhu Deva has made in the past, it comes as a surprise to see his name tagged to the movie. There have been reports in the past that apparently most of the film has been directed by his assistant director for the star choreographer turned filmmaker had way too busy with his future projects. One look at Ramaiya Vastavaiya and you start accepting that there really must be truth in that gossip. Not that Prabhu Deva has made films that have won critics' hearts but even by his masala potboiler standards, this Shruti Haasan starrer romantic film doesn't stand a chance. Reeking of cliches of the '80s and '90s Ramaiya Vastavaiya traces the story of a poor girl Sona (Shruti Haasan) whose farmer brother (Sonu Sood) can go to any length to keep her happy. Sona scoots off to her best friend's wedding and during the course of her 15 day stay falls head over heels in love with her best friend's cousin from Australia Ram (Girish Kumar). All hell breaks loose when the elders of the family get to know of this rich-boy-poor-girl love story. Accusing the girl of maneuvering the boy to fall in love with her, they make the two break up. The girl is sent packing off back to her village but the boy soon follows her till there and on being questioned about his worthiness and love for the girl by her brother gets onto the mission to prove himself! One wonders what the target audience of this romantic saga is because there barely must be people who wouldn't have seen Maine Pyar Kiya or Pyaar Kiya Toh Darna Kya. The movie despite being a remake of Prabhu Deva's debut Telugu hit draws heavy inspiration from the films mentioned above. The formula caper has its elements of sugary sweetness but there's no amount of painstaking labour that saves this film from being a rehash material. Even the loud over the top comedy can only work for the people who find amateurish attempts funny or derive sadist pleasure in unintentional humour. The South Indian filmmaking style can be seen in the way the characters are established or the humour is doled out which may work for the people in South but in mainstream Bollywood it only appears like a jaded and annoying product. Debutant Girish Kumar who also happens to be the producer Kumar Taurani's son gets a perfect platform to showcase every element of being a hero. Right from playing a Casanova to the love-sick pup to even the hero who beats villains to pulp, Girish can be seen profiling himself in every manner possible throughout the film, not to mention the many lovey-dovey songs and dance numbers. Shruti Haasan who has another film D-Day releasing this week itself tries too hard to play the girl-next-door, a role typified by Amrita Rao in Bollywood at present and fails terribly at it. Barring just expressions of crying and sulking Haasan barely gets to offer more. Music by Sachin Jigar works in part. While some songs grow on you slowly the others are just ear-splitting and torturous. Ramaiya Vastavaiya in short in a highly formulaic film which has absolutely nothing novel to offer. A clear case of old wine in a new bottle.</Review>

      <Review Name="Madhureeta Mukherjee" Affiliation="Times of India" Date="19th July,2013" Likes="">Welcome to Animal Farm. With ample chicks, hens, horns; many 'murgas', mulgis, mummyjis and baaratis. Add to this rustic beauty some colours of harvest, village belles, jadoo ki jhappi (read: item number by Jacqueline Fernandez) and of course, amidst it all - blooming romance in fields of gold. In pure Prabhudheva style - with spoonfuls of desi ghee! Ram (Girish), billionaire baap (Randhir) ka beta from Australia, lands in India for a wedding, where he's stunned to see lovely ladies bedecked in salwar-kamzeez and sarees (Whaaat? Kis khet ki mooli hai yeh?!). He falls in love with the bride's best friend, the simple gaon-ki-chori, Sona (Shruti). She's forced to leave him, but Ram follows her to the village and swears to win over her bhaiya, the proud kisaan, Raghuvir (Sonu). The billion-dollar-baby turns desi-cool - He ploughs, milks the cows (even puts them on a diet), and does a 'shitload' of work (with gobar, ghaas, et al). The film (remake of Prabhudheva's debut directorial Telugu film) isn't ripe with any newness - in story or direction. In fact, it discernibly replants stories from the 80's-90's era (remember: 'Maine Pyar Kiya', 'Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya'), with cliches, a banal plot, an field-full of supporting cast (of which Kapoor and Khanna are underused but good) and a budding lead pair. Debutant Girish makes a splash of an entry (surfing in blue seas, 'Bond' babes take a bow), and dances with flair. His overly exuberant performance seems flaky in the first half. Later, when he turns from a cool to kisaan, he breaks loose and performs a tad better. Shruti looks the desi beauty; her performance is not striking, yet likeable. Sonu is the best of the 'crop', his years of labour as an actor shows. There are few good laughs, doses of sweetness and fresh melodies (Sachin-Jigar), but sadly even that is mowed down by heightened histrionics, routine dialogues and a trite tale. This one's like a pretty field decked up in celebration, but with no real harvest to show.</Review>

      <Review Name="Rajeev Masand" Affiliation="CNN IBN" Date="7th June,2013" Likes="">How much you enjoy 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' depends entirely on how much you've missed the typical Karan Johar formula. 'Wake Up Sid' director Ayan Mukerji takes us on a familiar journey through holiday romances, family conundrums, and big fat Indian weddings. It's predictable every step of the way, but Mukerji has a superb cast that never slips, even when his script does. The film is predictable every step of the way, but director Ayan Mukerji has a superb cast that never slips, even when his script does. Straight-laced 'Scholar Naina' (Deepika Padukone) has little in common with thrill-seeking Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor) when she joins him and his two best friends - Aditi (Kalki Koechlin) and Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) - on a trip to Manali. But after a series of collective experiences, including a messy run-in with the locals, a midnight trek to a high-altitude peak, and intoxicated Holi celebrations, she's lost her inhibitions and also her heart. Too bad Bunny is focused on chasing his dream to travel the world, unwilling to let anything or anyone hold him back. When they're all reunited at a wedding eight years later, Bunny must ask himself if he really wants to make the same choices all over again. Although writer-director Ayan Mukerji sets his story in a world far from 'Wake Up Sid', he still has his hero go through an existential crisis in both life and love. If his first film was about a slacker finding a purpose, the message in 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' is that life can pass you by, if you don't stop to savor the moments. This idea, however, is couched in the template of a dozen love stories starting from 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge' and 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'. It's a pity the treatment has a been-there-seen-that feel to it because there are some modern ideas hidden underneath all that fluff. Part of what makes 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' warm and fuzzy is the friendship that Bunny and his die-hard buddies Aditi and Avi share, despite their shifting dynamics over eight years. Mukerji understands and nicely puts across the bittersweet qualities that friendships go through, and more often than once I found myself misty-eyed. Even love is viewed rather practically by the four key characters here - it's nice if you've found someone, but it needn't be the end of the world if you're not in a relationship. It's refreshing also that Mukerji doesn't tie up all the loose ends in the movie; not everyone gets the perfect happy ending. These are, however, small mercies in a film that smacks of assembly line reproduction. The high-gloss, picture-postcard cinematography, the gilt-edged production design, and the unending scenes of wedding revelry and over-choreographed dance numbers have that distinct Dharma Productions stamp on them, each frame oozing excess. Still, they're a lot less clumsy than the scenes of faux realism - like that entirely needless prologue in a Mumbai brothel where Bunny breaks into a dance with a hooker, even if she is played by Madhuri Dixit. Equally unconvincing is the intended grittiness in a sequence where an older Bunny, now a documentary film cameraman, daringly ventures into a seedy European ghetto shooting drug peddlers on the sly. Many of the film's problems, fortunately, are smoothened out by the terrific cast. Kalki Koechlin invests heart and spunkiness to the part of brash tomboy Aditi who is the glue that binds this group, while Aditya Roy Kapur is entirely likeable as the goofy Avi. The film benefits even from the spot-on timing of bit players like Dolly Ahluwalia and Kunal Roy Kapur, while Farooque Shaikh melts your heart in a two-scene cameo. Ranbir Kapoor turns on the charm in full heartthrob mode. He's pitch-perfect as the devil-may-care wanderer and flirt, and yet chokes you up in the more vulnerable, sensitive flashes. It's difficult to stand out in the same frame as Ranbir, but Deepika Padukone knocks it out of the park as Naina. She brings a lovely innocence to the early scenes, and then an understated sexiness when we meet her again in the film's second half. The pair sparks off each other, displaying a searing chemistry that neither has shared with other co-stars. Too long by at least twenty minutes, this is a watchable film despite its conventional arc. Fans of 'Wake Up Sid' will likely miss the original voice Mukerji revealed in his surprisingly mature debut, but with this one he shows he can do formula with as much ease. I'm going with three out of five for 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani'. If light-hearted mush is what you're seeking, you're looking in the right place.</Review>

      <Review Name="Sukanya Verma" Affiliation="Hindustan Times" Date="31st May,2013" Likes="">You can�t have it all. You will miss out on some things. So why not enjoy what�s in hand?� recommends Naina enjoying the gorgeous view from a vantage point of a grand fort, just few minutes short of witnessing a breathtaking sunset. Bunny, the recipient of her suggestion, reluctantly agrees. They have a good evening. Director Ayan Mukerji�s second endeavour, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani works exactly like this scene from the movie. You know that content smile you return with after spending time in fond company over effortless laughter and magical connections? That. The opposites attract genre isn�t path-breaking. Like �dal chawal� which is an oft-used analogy in the romance, certain inevitability is a given. So you always know what it�s about, where it�s headed, what it�ll deliver but if it can still be fun then, the challenge is more than fulfilled.  Mukerji has crafted a film about characters he clearly cares about and wants you to do the same, where even if the conclusion is a tad convenient, it�s the one you want to see. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is about four friends, their camaraderie, adventures, discoveries, dreams and decisions over a mountain holiday and a destination wedding. (Here, parents are mostly on the periphery except a fleeting interaction with Bunny and Naina�s.) Click! It�s a perfectly glamorous setting (shot by V Manikandan) and gives him abundant opportunity to live it up in a manner his producer Karan Johar can feel either proud or outdone. But I am pretty sure it�s the first one considering the magnanimity he�s shown in loosening the purse strings -- some thousand champagne glasses are destroyed for a stunning slo-mo second of a lavish party song.  But he has his own disarming style. His protagonists are not mere character sketches but a beautiful version of people you know/knew.  Remember that boy in class who could fix everything with a smile and get away saying the most outrageous things without batting an eyelid? Or his best friend and partner-in-crime who backed all that wild behaviour by contributing plenty of his own? How their singular aim is to drink and get everyone drunk -- those seemingly careless blokes who secretly care a great deal. Or the hard-talking �one of the boys� girl with enough feisty bones in her petite frame to give Manali�s bullies a run for their money? And, most importantly, that shy girl that brought out the Shah Rukh Khan in every boy, the one you wish to �palat�? Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor), Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur), Aditi (Kalki Koechlin) and Naina (Deepika Padukone) -- they�re all a product of those same filmi values and fascination, where ice can be broken over something as simple and silly as Bachchan�s strenuous moves in Jumma Chumma De De (Hum). And this I loved about YJHD, how Bollywood runs subconsciously in their blood -- the approach makes a world of a difference to the narrative. The upshot is a sublime celebration not a done-to-death tribute. At a little less than three hours running time, YJHD is essentially two chapters. In the first half, the foursome hang out in the picturesque, snow-clad hill station of Manali to engage in trekking, adventures, mandatory dimwits, jealousy and coming-of-age. Mukerji cultivates the blossoming chemistry between the travel aficionado Bunny and Neuroimmunology-studying Naina at leisure. Their moments always end on a poetic ellipsis, the attraction must bear slow-brewing conviction, he prioritises. It�s a good call by the young filmmaker since it certainly helps the emotionality during the second phase of their affinity, which has an underlining philosophy of true love bringing out the best in a person. Of course, since the events take place around a fancy Udaipur wedding (where you actually see brief glimpses of the extent of preparation that goes in high-society festivities), the leading quartet finds more reasons to party. The pace does drop intermittently for the sake of accommodating brightly-picturised songs (composed by Pritam) but its crisply-written script doles out enough humour to complement the inevitable sentimentality. I, for one, simply loved the uncomplicated, blunt wit of Hussain Dalal�s chuckle-worthy dialogues (Abbe dhongi, tu cheating nahi karta toh ab tak fourth standard mein hi hota, Venice, Europe ka dharavi hai). Moreover, Mukerji�s actors appear to understand his vision intimately.  Ranbir Kapoor is perfectly cast as the hippie-at-heart Bunny.  Whether he�s sipping Roohafza with his dad (Farookh Shaikh, two scenes is all it takes to convey brilliance), telling Deepika Padukone how special she is, fondly referring to his gal pal Kalki as �Mere Cheetah� or shaking a leg with a tantalising Madhuri Dixit, the extent of romanticism, charisma and verve he conveys; lends YJHD all the personality it needs.  Kalki Koechlin is precious as the emo turned Emma and induces a big grin every time she gets hostile, �Tere baap ke sandwiches hain kya?� Aditya Roy Kapur is somewhat overshadowed but his droopy shoulders and smiley-faced indifference conceal a story that�s only implied never realised to focus on the sweeping chemistry between Ranbir and Deepika. They�ve worked before (in Bachna Ae Haseeno) but the timing in YJHD is something else. Also, Deepika has never looked this radiant and fragile. She exudes grace and sensitivity as Naina, not quite the filmi definition of nerd. She wears glasses but her frames are stylish not over-sized monstrosities designed to make her look unsightly. She is quite a sharp dresser (unless your idea of chic is Evelyn Sharma�s tacky wardrobe). Sure, she prays. But there�s none of that exasperating Katrina Kaif�s barter approach with God. Naina is reserved and self-conscious and one endearing scene, �You�re dying to party, right?� captures the core of her soul perfectly.  Often change is depicted with a makeover in our movies. Here too, all four, go from college teens to professional adults in their late 20s. They do start dressing differently. There�s a certain refinement that comes with age and making money after all. But they don�t change, they just grow up. Their essence remains unaffected. Avi is still the playful, reckless charmer with a drink in hand. Naina�s competitive streak surfaces during the bride versus groom sangeet program. Aditi�s wardrobe is all ladylike but she hasn�t lost an ounce of her lively spunk. And Bunny is unpredictable as ever. Something Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is not. But who cares? Romance is back with a bang and it is exuberant, entertaining, dazzling and worth your time.</Review>

      <Review Name="Shubra Gupta" Affiliation="Indian Express" Date="1st June,2013" Likes="15">It's been a few minutes since I stepped out of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, and I'm finding it hard to remember what I've just seen. This is not the sort of amnesia that you have to force yourself into after a bad, blah film. This is because I've seen this brand new film, and its characters so many, many times before. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is a been-here, seen-this, much-too-long glossy creature, and not much else. Ranbir Kapoor plays the I-want-to-fly fellow who doesn't want to be tied down. Familiar? Oh yeah, we've seen a hundred variations of Bunny aka Kabir Thapar. Deepika Padukone is Naina, the proverbial girl in the glasses, always with her nose buried in a book, always driven to doing the right thing. Seen that before? So when Bunny and Naina meet and bicker and get intense and part, we know where this is headed. Which we are ready for, because that's what romantic comedies are about. But the thing with the best rom-coms is how the oldest story in the world � boy meets girl, and they live happily ever after � gets a fresh telling. On that crucial test, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani scores low. The supporting parts, essayed by Kalki Koechlin and Aditya Roy Kapur, her as the cool chick who then does the conventional thing like saying yes to an arranged marriage, and him as the hero's best buddy who turns hostile for no convincing reason, are also cobbled from bits and pieces. Because it is a Karan Johar production, we get the big fat Indian wedding, the geet and the sangeet and the whole zardozi, lehnga, mehndi, shebang, in multifarious doses. We also get Madhuri Dixit as Item Girl, and she blanks out as soon as she's out of sight, too. Ayan Mukherji had debuted in 2009 with Wake Up Sid starring Ranbir Kapoor, and that was a coming-of-age-of-urban-slacker-romance with some nuance. Here, he throws spikiness to the winds, and gives us glitter. Which is fine up to a point. Who doesn't like to see shiny, happy people doing shiny, happy things? But then when you start wanting more, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani gets into its long length of templates and tropes. That high-on-energy Ranbir shake-shake Badtameez Dil had my foot tapping, but hey, we know he's a good dancer. So what's new? The foursome gets to spend time in Manali in the first half, where they squeal and giggle and play pranks and look a little older than they should. Post interval, they are in Udaipur (Ranbir also gets to swan around pretty places in Europe and LA, so we can see what a hot shot photographer he's become), doing the marriage thing, and the cementing-the-cracks-in-friendship thing, and the return-of-the-prodigal thing. It is Ranbir, and a few of his climactic moments with Deepika (they begin with distressingly little going on between them), as well as a few emotive scenes with Farooq Shaikh, who plays his father, that stay with you. The Kapoor lad gets a nice matter-of-factness to loverboy self, and allows himself to be overcome when the time is right. One of these days, someone in this new-age Bollywood will make a cracking romance, and cast Ranbir as the lover, and give him something true to do. Now that will be something to watch.</Review>

      <Review Name="Vinayak Chakravorty" Affiliation="India Today" Date="31st May,2013" Likes="2">Picture this: Sid of Wake Up Sid is a few years older from where we saw him. Still scared of commitment, still wants to be the free bird but now he has a steady job for sustenance. The all-important factor of mush floats in with the film's heroine who is, of course, his polar opposite - focussed, respects family values but leads a claustrophobic life. Ayan Mukerji's second film is exactly the second film you would expect from director who made his debut with Wake Up Sid, driven by the pros and cons that come in the wake. You have here a slightly more mature Ayan as storyteller, and technically his craft is a few notches higher too. Yet just like Bunny, the funnily named protagonist played by Ranbir Kapoor, Ayan's cinematic idiom still seems trapped in a happy-go-lucky teenage universe. Ranbir (and Deepika) fans are bound to find that bit cute. The film has packaged its lead duo smartly to live up to its jawaani-deewani tag. It's more of jawaani than deewani, though. The joys, hopes, angst and despair of youth are all served with a designer-perfect punch through the story of four youngsters. But the film seems to lack a certain passion and guts to push the envelope while portraying today's youth. If Ranbir Kapoor has come to define GenNow Bollywood for most, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is packaged almost entirely around its hero. At the same time a rom-com, a road movie and a coming-of-age trip, Ayan's new film should keep its target audience - the urban multiplex crowd - happy. Ranbir's Bunny is a videographer for a TV travel show while Deepika plays Naina, doctor in the making who takes off on a trek trip to Manali to let off steam. Their few good traits will evidently rub off on each other. Tagged along are Bunny's buddies, the drifter Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) and the tomboy Aditi (Kalki). Naina joins the wild trio and is obviously the odd one out. The holiday ends, the foursome parts ways, only to reunite years later at Aditi's marriage (yes, it's a K.Jo production so we won't miss the scope for the shaadi naach gaana). What follows is meant to twist the Bollywood romance. It doesn't, quite. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, lovable as it is, simply refuses to move beyond box-office diktats. Well-penned roles are in order for Aditya and Kalki, although they get restrained footage. Both actors impress despite staying in Ranbir and Deepika's shadows. Ayan scripts a fantastic scope for chemistry for his lead duo and Ranbir-Deepika live it up. The sizzle they share remains the film's highlight. Ranbir fans in particular would invariably notice how he smoothly continues growing as an actor-superstar. And yeah... he does well to match Madhuri Dixit's groove step for step, doesn't he?</Review>

      <Review Name="Saibal Chatterjee" Affiliation="NDTV" Date="31st May,2013" Likes="7">Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is a bright, breezy and brassy film designed for easy consumption. What it certainly is not is ballsy. For all the big ideas about life and the dilemmas of youth that it tosses up in the air over a runtime that�s 20 minutes shy of three hours, it always opts to play safe, vacillating between thoughts of rebellion and acts of conformity. The characters spout familiar platitudes to each other: live your dream, get a life and move on, stop pitying yourself and learn to love thyself�We have seen and heard it all before. In the first half of the film, four happy-go-lucky school buddies with superficially defined traits reunite to go on a trekking trip to Manali and beyond. Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor) is footloose and dreams of exploring the world. Aditi (Kalki Koechlin) is wild and fancy-free. Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) is a drifter happy to blow up his cash on cricket bets. Naina (Deepika Padukone) is the odd one out. She is a bespectacled and sedate medical student. She joins the gang in an act of impulsive defiance but cannot break away from her neuro-immunology textbook even as the rest of the traveling party live it up on the road. By the end of the adventure-filled sojourn through the ups and downs of the undulating landscape, each of the four is transformed a little, but only to go his/her way. Eight years later, one of the two girls in the group, Aditi, decides to marry a straight-laced engineer (Kunaal Roy Kapur) and her old friends descend on a resort in Udaipur for the grand betrothal. And like they did the first time around, they come and go talking about love, friendship and the need to grow up even as they consume a whole lot of liquor. Between the swigs, love and friendship do happen, but the quartet does not quite grow up. The high-flying Bunny, after several years of globe-trotting as a television cameraman, talks of the pleasure of watching Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. In response, the more rooted Naina extols the joy of seeing Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge with a tub of popcorn at Maratha Mandir. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is clearly more of the latter than the former although it does occasionally betray the ambition to be larger in scope than what it is capable of. It is a mildly diverting film at best. Its musical set pieces are robustly staged and with Ranbir Kapoor at the centre of them all, they are fun while they last. The characters are rather sketchily etched and the psychological bends that they encounter on the way to self-realization are far too simplistic to catch the audience by surprise. Neither the romance nor the drama that the film seeks to whip up can salvage it from being just another harmless romp aimed at an undemanding audience that is comfortable with swimming at the shallow end of life. There is no denying, however, that Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is gorgeously filmed, the locations are eye-popping, and the guys and dolls that people the tale are a bunch of attractive people. The two lead actors, Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, do make a fetching onscreen pair. And they are well complemented by Aditya Roy Kapur and Kalki Koechlin. It is the erratic narrative arc that is a letdown. Overlong, sluggish and fluffy, it meanders through varied locations as the young lovers/friends seek to reconnect with each other after a few years of being apart. The song and dance routines, no matter how foot-tapping they are, do not quite possess the kind of infectious energy that can offset the clich�s around which they are wrapped and turn the film into something more than just superficially enjoyable. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is a mix of Dil Chahta Hai and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, with dollops of 3 Idiots thrown in for good measure. It is all served up in a Karan Johar-style concoction where the backdrops � both indoors and the locations � are infinitely more expressive than the inner worlds of the young characters. The impulses of the quartet of friends, who predictably include one couple that is on the verge of a lifelong relationship but are either unable or not keen enough to express their love for each other, are hardly explained in logical and convincing terms. As a result, the fragmented storyline hurtles forward only in fits and starts. The heroine is head over heels in love. The boy she is smitten with is averse to making a commitment. The girl is unable to communicate her true feelings. So you know exactly what the outcome is going to be. They will keep crossing each other�s path until true love is found. Director Ayan Mukherji, who gave an impressive account of himself in his debut film, Wake Up Sid, appears to have allowed the skills that he displayed the first time around to go into deep slumber. Not that Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is a sleeping pill. It is not. But it could certainly have done with a little more narrative verve. Do make it a point to get into your seat before the show begins. Madhuri Dixit�s item song plays out ten minutes into the film. Watch Ranbir Kapoor match steps with the still-lustrous diva and you know why this guy is special. Watch Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani for him.</Review>
